These fishes are important contributors to the biological carbon pump via their feeding and behaviors, whereby they facilitate the transfer of carbon from shallow waters to the deep sea. Several species undertake diel vertical migration, feeding in shallower waters at night and moving to deeper waters during the day. This process actively expedites the downward flux of carbon. However, carbon budgets and climate models require accurate information regarding the depth distributions and migration patterns of these fishes, and environmental DNA (eDNA) analyses can provide this information. Here, we utilize eDNA approaches, generating taxonomically-informative COI and 12S reference barcodes for 80 species of mesopelagic fishes, which can be used for species-level identification of eDNA sequences. Using these, along with a publicly available barcodes database, we compare results from eDNA analysis with traditional net sampling, and explore the ability of eDNA techniques to detect diel vertical migration in fishes from samples collected in Northwest Atlantic Slope Water. We found that eDNA and net samples often resulted in different species identifications, demonstrating that eDNA can detect species that would otherwise be missed with traditional methods. In our eDNA samples, we also detected more species (12) in our shallowest depth category (0 - 100 m) from night samples than from day samples (3). This is consistent with increased diversity in shallow waters at night due to diel vertical migration. Based on the variability observed in sample duplicates, we suggest that future mesopelagic eDNA studies incorporate larger sample volumes and scaled-up sampling efforts. We also note the potential applications of eDNA analysis in addressing ecological questions related to predator-prey relationships identification of foraging hotspots, and carbon flow through the ocean's midwaters.","[Govindarajan, Annette F.; Llopiz, Joel K.; Caiger, Paul E.; Mcmonagle, Helena; Wiebe, Peter H.] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Biol Dept, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; [Caiger, Paul E.] Univ Auckland, Inst Marine Sci, Auckland, New Zealand; [Jech, J.

Environmental DNA (eDNA) analyses show great promise for efficiently characterizing biodiversity and could provide new insight into the presence of mesopelagic species, including those that are missed by traditional net sampling. Here, we explore the utility of eDNA for identifying animal taxa. We describe the results from an August 2018 cruise in Slope Water off the northeast United States. Samples for eDNA analysis were collected using Niskin bottles during five CTD casts. Sampling depths along each cast were selected based on the presence of biomass as indicated by the shipboard Simrad EK60 echosounder. Metabarcoding of the 18S V9 gene region was used to assess taxonomic diversity. eDNA metabarcoding results were compared with those from net-collected (MOCNESS) plankton samples. We found that the MOCNESS sampling recovered more animal taxa, but the number of taxa detected per liter of water sampled was significantly higher in the eDNA samples. eDNA was especially useful for detecting delicate gelatinous animals which are undersampled by nets. We also detected eDNA changes in community composition with depth, but not with sample collection time (day vs. night). We provide recommendations for applying eDNA-based methods in the mesopelagic including the need for studies enabling interpretation of eDNA signals and improvement of barcode reference databases.","[Govindarajan, Annette F.; Francolini, Rene D.; Llopiz, Joel K.; Wiebe, Peter H.] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Biol, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; [Jech, J.

For the majority of eDNA studies, genetic assays are designed to target mitochondrial genes commonly referred to as barcode regions. However, unlike the typical structure of an animal mitochondrial genome, those for the invasive zebra and quagga mussels are greatly expanded with large extended tandem repeat regions. These sections of repeated DNA can appear hundreds of times within the genome compared to a single copy for the mitochondrial barcode genes. This higher number of target copies per mitochondrial genome presents an opportunity to increase eDNA assay sensitivity for these species. Therefore, we designed and evaluated new eDNA assays to target the extended repeat sections for both zebra and quagga mussels. These assays lower the limit of detection of genomic DNA by 100-fold for zebra mussels and 10-fold for quagga mussels. Additionally, these newly developed assays provided longer durations of detection during degradation mesocosm experiments and greater sensitivity for eDNA detection from water samples collected across western Lake Erie compared to standard assays targeting mitochondrial genes. This work illustrates how understanding the complete genomic structure of an organism can improve eDNA analysis.","[Marshall, Nathaniel T.; Chaganti, Subba Rao] Univ Michigan, Cooperat Inst Great Lakes Res CIGLR, 4840 South State Rd, Ann Arbor, MI 48108 USA; [Marshall, Nathaniel T.] Stantec Consulting Ltd, 1500 Lake Shore Dr, Columbus, OH 43204 USA; [Vanderploeg, Henry A.] NOAA, Great Lakes Environm Res Lab, 4840 South State Rd, Ann Arbor, MI 48108 USA","University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA","Chaganti, SR (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Cooperat Inst Great Lakes Res CIGLR, 4840 South State Rd, Ann Arbor, MI 48108 USA.","nathaniel.marshall@stantec.com; henry.vanderploeg@noaa.gov; chaganti@umich.edu","Chaganti, Subba/AAO-8118-2020","Marshall, Nathaniel/0000-0002-0548-4273; Chaganti, Subba Rao/0000-0001-9796-3986","University of Michigan [NA17OAR4320152]; NOAA","University of Michigan(University of Michigan System); NOAA(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA)","Funding was awarded to the Cooperative Institute for Great Lakes Research (CIGLR) through the NOAA Cooperative Agreement with the University of Michigan (NA17OAR4320152).

The majority of the remaining barcodes are shared by only two species.

However, the extent to which current methods optimize fish eDNA detection from water samples is unknown. Here, we test modifications to laboratory components of an eDNA metabarcoding protocol targeting marine finfish. As compared to baseline methods, amplifying a smaller proportion of extracted DNA yielded fewer species, and, conversely, amplifying a larger proportion identified more taxa. Higher-read species were amplified more reproducibly and with less variation in read number than were lower-read species. Among pooled samples, 20-fold deeper sequencing recovered one additional fish species out of a total of 63 species. No benefit was observed with additional PCR cycles, alternative primer concentrations, or fish-selective primers. Experiments using an exogenous DNA standard to assess absolute eDNA concentration suggested that, for a given proportion of a DNA sample, current laboratory methods for metabarcoding marine fish eDNA are near to maximally sensitive. Our results support the unofficial standard collection volume of one liter for eDNA assessment of commonly encountered marine fish species.

Although the number of studies using eDNA analysis in marine systems is continually increasing, there appears to be no published studies investigating the use of eDNA analysis to detect sea turtles in natural conditions. We tested the efficacy of two primer pairs known to amplify DNA fragments of differing lengths (488 and 253 bp) from Chelonia mydas tissues for detecting C. mydas eDNA in water samples. The capture, extraction, and amplification of C. mydas eDNA from aquaria (Sea World, San Diego, CA, United States) and natural water (San Diego Bay, CA, United States) were successful using either primer set. The primer pair providing the shorter amplicon, LCMint2/H950g, demonstrated the ability to distinguish cross-reactive species by melt curve analysis and provided superior amplification metrics compared to the other primer set (LTCM2/HDCM2); although primer dimer was observed, warranting future design refinement. Results indicated that water samples taken from deeper depths might improve detection frequency, consistent with C. mydas behaviour. Overall, this pilot study suggests that with refinement of sampling methodology and further assay optimisation, eDNA analysis represents a promising tool to monitor C. mydas. Potential applications include rapid assessment across broad geographical areas to pinpoint promising locations for further evaluation with traditional methods.","[Harper, Kirsten J.] Univ Miami, Cooperat Inst Marine & Atmospher Studies, Miami, FL 33146 USA; [Harper, Kirsten J.; Goodwin, Kelly D.] NOAA, Ocean Chem & Ecosyst Div, Atlantic Oceanog & Meteorol Lab, Stationed Southwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Harper, Lynsey R.] Univ Illinois, Prairie Res Inst, Illinois Nat Hist Survey, Champaign, IL USA; [LaCasella, Erin L.; Frey, Amy; Dutton, Peter H.] NOAA, Marine Mammal & Turtle Div, Southwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, La Jolla, CA USA","University of Miami; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Atlantic Oceanographic & Meteorological Laboratory (AOML); University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; Illinois Natural History Survey; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA","Harper, KJ (corresponding author), Univ Miami, Cooperat Inst Marine & Atmospher Studies, Miami, FL 33146 USA.;Harper, KJ (corresponding author), NOAA, Ocean Chem & Ecosyst Div, Atlantic Oceanog & Meteorol Lab, Stationed Southwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.","kirsten.harper@noaa.gov","Harper, Lynsey/AAQ-2705-2020; Goodwin, Kelly/B-4985-2014","Goodwin, Kelly/0000-0001-9583-8073; Harper, Lynsey/0000-0003-0923-1801","NOAA Southwest Fisheries Science Center; NOAA Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research's Omics Initiative","NOAA Southwest Fisheries Science Center(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); NOAA Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research's Omics Initiative(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA)","This work was funded by the NOAA Southwest Fisheries Science Center and the NOAA Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research's Omics Initiative.

Interval and continuous video recording strategies were tested. During interval recording, cameras collected 8 min video segments hourly from 07:00 to 19:00 h on cages only. Continuous video was also collected for 2-3 h on oyster cages and boulders. Data loggers recorded light intensity and current speed. Seawater was collected for eDNA metabarcoding on the reef and farm. MaxN measurements of fish abundance were calculated in video, and 7 fish species were observed. Black sea bass Centropristis striata, cunner Tautogolabrus adspersus, scup Stenotomus chrysops, and tautog Tautoga onitis were the most abundant species observed in both oyster cage and boulder videos. In continuous video, black sea bass, scup, and tautog were observed more frequently and at higher abundance on the cage farm, while cunner were observed more frequently and at higher abundance on boulders within the rock reef. eDNA metabarcoding detected 42 fish species at the farm and reef. Six species were detected using both methods. Applied in tandem, video recording and eDNA provided a comprehensive approach for describing fish assemblages in difficult to sample structured oyster aquaculture and boulder habitats.","[Mercaldo-Allen, Renee; Clark, Paul; Liu, Yuan; Phillips, Gillian; Redman, Dylan; Estela, Erick; Milke, Lisa; Rose, Julie M.] NOAA Fisheries, Northeast Fisheries Sci Ctr, Milford Lab, 212 Rogers Ave, Milford, CT 06460 USA; [Liu, Yuan; Phillips, Gillian] AIS Inc, 540 Hawthorn St, N Dartmouth, MA 02747 USA; [Auster, Peter J.] Univ Connecticut, Dept Marine Sci & Myst Aquarium, 1080 Shennecossett Rd, Groton, CT 06340 USA; [Verkade, Alison] NOAA Fisheries, Greater Atlantic Reg Fisheries Off, Habitat Conservat Div, 55 Great Republ Dr, Gloucester, MA 01930 USA","National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of Connecticut; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA","Rose, JM (corresponding author), NOAA Fisheries, Northeast Fisheries Sci Ctr, Milford Lab, 212 Rogers Ave, Milford, CT 06460 USA.","julie.rose@noaa.gov","Auster, Peter/ABI-3568-2020","Phillips, Gillian/0000-0002-7852-1880; Liu, Yuan/0000-0002-4741-8100; Rose, Julie/0000-0001-9796-9974","NOAA's Northeast Fisheries Science Center; Office of Aquaculture","NOAA's Northeast Fisheries Science Center(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); Office of Aquaculture","We thank David Carey, Kristin DeRosia-Banick, and Shannon Kelly of the State of Connecticut, Bureau of Aquaculture; shellfish growers Robert Granfield, Gary Salce of G & B Shellfish and Charles Viens of Charles Island Oyster Farms for access to leased shellfish beds; NOAA divers Calandrea DeCastro, Mark Dixon, Keith Golden, Jerry Prezioso, and Barry Smith for dive support; Arthur Allen of the Coast Guard Office of Search and Rescue for analysis of current meter data; John Pinkowski and Fisher Island Oysters for the loan of seed oysters; Robert Alix and Eileen Bates for support of field operations; David Hudson of Norwalk Maritime Aquarium for technical assistance; and NOAA's Northeast Fisheries Science Center and Office of Aquaculture for funding.

However, accurate estimation of age and origin of eDNA is complicated by particle transport and the presence of legacy genetic material, which can obscure accurate interpretation of eDNA detection and quantification. To understand the state of genomic material within the environment, we investigated the degradation relationships between (a) size of fragments (long vs short), (b) genomic origins (mitochondrial vs nuclear), (c) nucleic acids (eDNA vs eRNA), and (d) RNA types (messenger (m)RNA vs ribosomal (r)RNA) from non-indigenous Dreissena mussels. Initial concentrations of eRNA followed expected transcriptional trends, with rRNAs found at>1000xthat of eDNA, and a mitosis-associated mRNA falling below detection limits within 24 h. Furthermore, the ratio of eRNA:eDNA significantly decreased throughout degradation, potentially providing an estimate for the age of genomic material. Thus, eRNA quantification can increase detection due to the high concentrations of rRNAs. Furthermore, it may improve interpretation of positive detections through the eRNA:eDNA ratio and/or by detecting low abundant mitosis-associated mRNAs that degrade within similar to 24 h.","[Marshall, Nathaniel T.; Chaganti, Subba Rao] Univ Michigan, Cooperat Inst Great Lakes Res, Sch Environm & Sustainabil, 440 Church St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Vanderploeg, Henry A.] NOAA, Great Lakes Environm Res Lab, 4840 S State Rd, Ann Arbor, MI 48108 USA","University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA","Chaganti, SR (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Cooperat Inst Great Lakes Res, Sch Environm & Sustainabil, 440 Church St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.","chaganti@umich.edu","Chaganti, Subba/AAO-8118-2020","Chaganti, Subba Rao/0000-0001-9796-3986; Marshall, Nathaniel/0000-0002-0548-4273","University of Michigan [NA17OAR4320152]; NOAA","University of Michigan(University of Michigan System); NOAA(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA)","Funding was awarded to the Cooperative Institute for Great Lakes Research (CIGLR) through the NOAA Cooperative Agreement with the University of Michigan (NA17OAR4320152).

In order to operationalize eDNA approaches for routine NOAA observatories, new bioinformatic programs and improved organismal reference barcodes are needed to provide accurate and reliable biological data in a timely manner. To address these needs, we present Rapid Exploration and Visualization through an Automated Metabarcoding Pipeline (REVAMP), which provides streamlined end-to-end data processing from raw reads to data exploration, visualization, and hypothesis generation. One benefit of REVAMP is the ability to iteratively assess marker gene and reference database performance. Here, we used a filtered reference database that only included sequences uploaded prior to specified date cutoffs from 1995 to 2022 to analyze changes in eDNA metabarcoding taxonomic assignments, revealing patterns of uneven improvement in taxonomic assignment depth and accuracy across time, region, and marker sets. This work highlights the need for targeted reference sequencing efforts for key regional taxa and the importance of such efforts for improving eDNA biomonitoring approaches in the future.","[McAllister, Sean M.] Univ Washington, Cooperat Inst Climate Ocean & Ecosyst Studies CIC, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [McAllister, Sean M.] NOAA, Pacific Marine Environm Lab PMEL, Seattle, WA 98115 USA; [Paight, Christopher] NOAA PMEL, Oceanog Genom, Seattle, WA USA; [Norton, Emily L.] Univ Washington, CICOES, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Norton, Emily L.; Galaska, Matthew P.] NOAA PMEL, Seattle, WA USA","University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA","McAllister, SM (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Cooperat Inst Climate Ocean & Ecosyst Studies CIC, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.;McAllister, SM (corresponding author), NOAA, Pacific Marine Environm Lab PMEL, Seattle, WA 98115 USA.","sean.mcallister@noaa.gov","Galaska, Mathew/L-3948-2019","McAllister, Sean/0000-0001-6654-3495","Cooperative Institute for Climate, Ocean, and Ecosystem Studies (CICOES) under NOAA [NA20OAR4320271, 2023-1294]","Cooperative Institute for Climate, Ocean, and Ecosystem Studies (CICOES) under NOAA(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA)","We would like to thank Zachary Gold and two external reviewers for their helpful feedback on the manuscript.

Here we used multilocus amplicon sequencing of eDNA to survey biodiversity from an eighteen-month (2015-2016) time-series of seawater samples from Monterey Bay, California. The resulting dataset encompasses 663 taxonomic groups (at Family or higher taxonomic rank) ranging from microorganisms to mammals. We inferred changes in the composition of communities, revealing putative interactions among taxa and identifying correlations between these communities and environmental properties over time. Community network analysis provided evidence of expected predator-prey relationships, trophic linkages, and seasonal shifts across all domains of life. We conclude that eDNA-based analyses can provide detailed information about marine ecosystem dynamics and identify sensitive biological indicators that can suggest ecosystem changes and inform conservation strategies. Increasingly, eDNA is being used to infer ecological interactions. Here the authors sample eDNA over 18 months in a marine environment and use co-occurrence network analyses to infer potential interactions among organisms from microbes to mammals, testing how they change over time in response to oceanographic factors.","[Djurhuus, Anni; Montes, Enrique; Otis, Daniel; Muller-Karger, Frank E.; Breitbart, Mya] Univ S Florida, Coll Marine Sci, 140 7th Ave South, St Petersburg, FL 33701 USA; [Closek, Collin J.; Starks, Hilary A.] Stanford Univ, Stanford Ctr Ocean Solut, 473 Via Ortega, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Closek, Collin J.; Starks, Hilary A.; Andruszkiewicz, Elizabeth A.; Boehm, Alexandria B.] Stanford Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 473 Via Ortega, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Kelly, Ryan P.] Univ Washington, Sch Marine & Environm Affairs, 3707 Brooklyn Ave, Seattle, WA 98105 USA; [Pitz, Kathleen J.; Michisaki, Reiko P.; Walz, Kristine R.; Chavez, Francisco P.] Monterey Bay Aquarium Res Inst, 7700 Sandholdt Rd, Moss Landing, CA 95039 USA; [Olesin, Emily; Hubbard, Katherine] Fish & Wildlife Res Inst, Florida Fish & Wildlife Res Conservat, 100 8th Ave SE, St Petersburg, FL 33701 USA","State University System of Florida; University of South Florida; Stanford University; Stanford University; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute; Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservation Commission","Djurhuus, A; Breitbart, M (corresponding author), Univ S Florida, Coll Marine Sci, 140 7th Ave South, St Petersburg, FL 33701 USA.;Closek, CJ (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Stanford Ctr Ocean Solut, 473 Via Ortega, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.;Closek, CJ (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 473 Via Ortega, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.","anni.djurhuus@gmail.com; closek@gmail.com; mya@usf.edu","Allan, Elizabeth/AAD-2255-2021; Breitbart, Mya/B-1366-2009","Starks, Hilary/0000-0002-1418-6331; Djurhuus, Anni/0000-0002-3517-7522; Montes, Enrique/0000-0002-3103-4479; Pitz, Kathleen/0000-0002-4931-8592; Boehm, Alexandria/0000-0002-8162-5090","NASA [NNX14AP62A, NOPP RFP NOAA-NOS-IOOS-2014-2003803]; NOAA [NOPP RFP NOAA-NOS-IOOS-2014-2003803]; BOEM [NOPP RFP NOAA-NOS-IOOS-2014-2003803]","NASA(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)); NOAA(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); BOEM","This work is a contribution to the Marine Biodiversity Observation Network (MBON).

The field of eDNA is relatively new but growing rapidly, and it has the potential to disrupt current paradigms developed on the basis of existing measurement methods. After a general review of the field, we provide specific examples of the type of information that eDNA provides regarding the changing distribution of life in the sea over space (horizontally and vertically) and time. We conclude that eDNA analyses yield results that are similar to those obtained using traditional observation methods, are complementary to them, and because of the breadth of information provided, have the potential to improve conservation and management practices. Moreover, through technology development and standardization of methods, eDNA offers a means to scale biological observations globally to a level similar to those currently made for ocean physics and biogeochemistry. This scaling can ultimately result in a far better understanding of global marine biodiversity and contribute to better management and sustainable use of the world ocean. Improved information management systems that track methods and associated metadata, together with international coordination, will be needed to realize a global eDNA observation network.","[Chavez, Francisco P.] Monterey Bay Aquarium Res Inst MBARI, Moss Landing, CA 95039 USA; [Min, Markus] Univ Washington, Sch Aquat & Fishery Sci, Seattle, WA USA; [Ritz, Kathleen; Truelove, Nathan; Baker, Jacoby; LaScala-Grunewald, Diana; Blum, Marguerite; Walz, Kristine; Ruhl, Henry A.; Scholin, Christopher A.] MBARI, Moss Landing, CA USA; [Nye, Charles] Oregon State Univ, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Djurhuus, Anni] Univ Faroe Isl, Torshavn, Faroe Islands, Denmark; [Miller, Robert J.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Marine Sci Inst, Santa Barbara, CA USA; [Goodwin, Kelly D.] Natl Ocean & Atmospher Adm, Atlantic Oceanog & Meteorol Lab, Ocean Chem & Ecosyst Div, Miami, FL USA; [Muller-Karger, Frank E.] Univ S Florida, Coll Marine Sci, St Petersburg, FL USA","Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute; Oregon State University; University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Atlantic Oceanographic & Meteorological Laboratory (AOML); State University System of Florida; University of South Florida","Chavez, FP (corresponding author), Monterey Bay Aquarium Res Inst MBARI, Moss Landing, CA 95039 USA.","chfr@mbari.org","Baker, Jacoby/JXL-2622-2024; min, Markus/IWV-3700-2023; Goodwin, Kelly/B-4985-2014","Baker, Jacoby/0000-0002-0673-7535; Goodwin, Kelly/0000-0001-9583-8073; Miller, Robert/0000-0002-8350-3759; Nye, Charles/0009-0009-5893-2891","NASA [NNX14AP62A, 80NSSCC20M001, 80NSSC21M0032]; NOAA [NA16NOS0120021]; David and Lucile Packard Foundation","NASA(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)); NOAA(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); David and Lucile Packard Foundation(The David & Lucile Packard Foundation)","This effort was funded by NASA awards NNX14AP62A, 80NSSCC20M001, and 80NSSC21M0032, NOAA award NA16NOS0120021, and by the David and Lucile Packard Foundation.",NA,69,16,18,3,23,"OCEANOGRAPHY SOC","ROCKVILLE","P.O.

In order to examine the influence of the water column on benthic eDNA surveys in regions targeted for deep-sea polymetallic nodule mining, we investigated the occurrence of pelagic eDNA across: (1) two different deep-sea habitat types, abyssal plains and seamounts, (2) benthic sample types, including nodules, sediment, and seawater within the benthic boundary layer (BBL), and (3) sediment depth horizons (0-2 and 3-5 cm). Little difference was observed between seamounts and the adjacent abyssal plains in the proportion of legacy pelagic eDNA sampled in the benthos, despite 1,000 m depth difference for these habitats. In terms of both reads and amplicon sequence variants (ASVs), pelagic eDNA was minimal within sediment and nodule samples (<2%), and is unlikely to affect benthic surveys that monitor resident organisms at the deep seafloor. However, pelagic eDNA was substantial within the BBL (up to 13% ASVs, 86% reads), derived both from the high-biomass upper ocean as well as deep pelagic residents. While most pelagic metazoan eDNA found in sediments and on nodules could be sourced from the epipelagic, protist legacy eDNA sampled on these substrates appeared to originate across a range of depths in the water column. Some evidence of eDNA degradation across a vertical sediment profile was observed for protists, with higher diversity in the 0-2 cm layer and a significantly lower proportion of legacy pelagic eDNA in deeper sediments (3-5 cm). Study-wide, our estimated metazoan sampling coverage ranged from 40 to 74%, despite relatively large sample size. Future deep-sea eDNA surveys should examine oceanographic influences on eDNA transport and residence times, consider habitat heterogeneity at a range of spatial scales in the abyss, and aim to process large amounts of material per sample (with replication) in order to increase the sampling coverage in these diverse deep ocean communities.","[Laroche, Olivier; Smith, Craig R.; Goetze, Erica] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Oceanog, Sch Ocean & Earth Sci & Technol, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Laroche, Olivier] Inst Marine Res, Tromso, Norway; [Kersten, Oliver] Univ Oslo, Dept Biosci, Ctr Ecol & Evolutionary Synth, Oslo, Norway","University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; Institute of Marine Research - Norway; University of Oslo","Laroche, O (corresponding author), Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Oceanog, Sch Ocean & Earth Sci & Technol, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.;Laroche, O (corresponding author), Inst Marine Res, Tromso, Norway.","olli.laroche@gmail.com","","Kersten, Oliver/0000-0001-9304-2493; Laroche, Olivier/0000-0003-0755-0083; Goetze, Erica/0000-0002-7273-4359","Pew Charitable Trusts [UH30788]; Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation [5596]; NOAA Ocean Exploration grant [NA17OAR0110209]; University of Hawai'i","Pew Charitable Trusts; Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation(Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation); NOAA Ocean Exploration grant(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); University of Hawai'i","Support for this project was provided by The Pew Charitable Trusts award UH30788 (to PIs EG and CS), Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation award 5596 (lead PIs CS and J.

In the case of the vast and remote ocean twilight zone (OTZ), management is particularly challenged by the lack of data. Traditional biodiversity monitoring methods are unable to scale efficiently or effectively to address these knowledge gaps and new technologies are needed to inform policy. Environmental DNA (eDNA) has quickly gained traction in recent years as an enabling technology for marine conservation that will play a transformative role in OTZ biodiversity conservation and high seas governance in general. Through a comprehensive review of science and policy literature and an analysis of existing global marine biodiversity data, we discuss the importance of biodiversity conservation in the OTZ, review existing knowledge gaps, and summarize recent developments in eDNA and OTZ biodiversity research. We identify the key components of an eDNA framework that are needed for OTZ biodiversity monitoring and discuss policy implications relevant to the recent Biodiversity Beyond National Jurisdiction (BBNJ) Agreement. We show that an integrated science-policy approach based on transdisciplinary eDNA research is essential for achieving sustainability in the OTZ and the 30x30 target for conserving ocean biodiversity.","[Yang, Nina; Govindarajan, Annette F.] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Biol Dept, Woods Hole, MA USA; [Yang, Nina; Jin, Di] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Marine Policy Ctr, Woods Hole, MA USA; [Yang, Nina] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, 266 Woods Hole Rd, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA","Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution; Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution; Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution","Yang, NN (corresponding author), Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, 266 Woods Hole Rd, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.","nina.yang@whoi.edu","Jin, Di/KHX-5887-2024","Jin, Di/0000-0002-6403-7983","Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution's Ocean Twilight Zone Project; Audacious Project; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA's) Ocean Exploration Cooperative Institute [NA19OAR4320072, 0007525/102212019]","Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution's Ocean Twilight Zone Project; Audacious Project; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA's) Ocean Exploration Cooperative Institute(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA)","We would like to thank Miranda Van Mooy for her research support on RFMOs and two anonymous reviewers for their constructive comments on an earlier version of the paper.

By enabling detection of species over space and time, eDNA fulfills a fundamental need of environmental surveys. Traditional surveys are expensive, require significant capital expenditure, and can be destructive; eDNA offers promise for cheaper, less invasive, and higher-resolution (i.e. genetic) assessments of environments and stocks. However, challenges in quantification, detection limits, biobanking capacity, reference databases, and data management and integration remain significant hurdles to efficient eDNA monitoring at global and decadal scale.

We support this effort by providing guidelines based on a review of published methods and field sampling experiences. The major components considered here are environmental and resource considerations, sample processing strategies, sample storage options, and eDNA extraction protocols. It is impossible to provide universal recommendations considering the wide range of eDNA applications; rather, we provide information to design fit-for-purpose protocols. To manage scope, the focus here is on sampling collection and preservation of prokaryotic and microeukaryotic eDNA. Even with a focused view, the practical utility of any approach depends on multiple factors, including habitat type, available resources, and experimental goals. We broadly recommend enacting rigorous decontamination protocols, pilot studies to guide the filtration volume needed to characterize the target(s) of interest and minimize PCR inhibitor collection, and prioritizing sample freezing over (only) the addition of preservation buffer. An annotated list of studies that test these parameters is included for more detailed investigation on specific steps. To illustrate an approach that demonstrates fit-for-purpose methodologies, we provide a protocol for eDNA sampling aboard an oceanographic vessel. These guidelines can aid the decision-making process for scientists interested in sampling and sequencing marine microbiomes and/or eDNA.","[Patin, Nastassia Virginia; Goodwin, Kelly D.] NOAA, Ocean Chem & Ecosyst Div, Atlantic Oceanog & Meteorol Lab, Miami, FL USA; [Patin, Nastassia Virginia] Univ Miami, Cooperat Inst Marine & Atmospher Studies, Rosenstiel Sch Marine Atmospher & Earth Sci, Miami, FL 33146 USA; [Patin, Nastassia Virginia; Goodwin, Kelly D.] NOAA, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Stationed Southwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA","National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Atlantic Oceanographic & Meteorological Laboratory (AOML); University of Miami; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA","Patin, NV (corresponding author), NOAA, Ocean Chem & Ecosyst Div, Atlantic Oceanog & Meteorol Lab, Miami, FL USA.;Patin, NV (corresponding author), Univ Miami, Cooperat Inst Marine & Atmospher Studies, Rosenstiel Sch Marine Atmospher & Earth Sci, Miami, FL 33146 USA.;Patin, NV (corresponding author), NOAA, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Stationed Southwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.","nastassia.patin@noaa.gov","Goodwin, Kelly/B-4985-2014","Goodwin, Kelly/0000-0001-9583-8073","National Oceanographic Partnership Program (NOPP); NOAA Omics Program; Cooperative Institute of Marine and Atmospheric Studies (CIMAS); Cooperative Institute of the University of Miami; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration [NA20OAR4320472]","National Oceanographic Partnership Program (NOPP); NOAA Omics Program(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); Cooperative Institute of Marine and Atmospheric Studies (CIMAS); Cooperative Institute of the University of Miami; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA)","We thank Francisco Chavez, Kobun Truelove, and Kathleen Pitz at MBARI for productive collaborations that led to the protocol presented in the addendum.

In aquatic systems, advantages of this method include the ability to concurrently monitor biodiversity and detect incipient invasions simply through the collection and analysis of water samples. However, depending on the molecular markers chosen for a given study, reference libraries containing target sequences from present species may limit the usefulness of eDNA metabarcoding. To explore the extent of this issue and how it may be resolved to aid biodiversity and invasive species early detection goals, we focus on fishes in the well-studied Laurentian Great Lakes region. First, we provide a synthesis of species currently known from the region and of non-indigenous species identified as threats by international, national, regional, and introduction pathway-specific fish risk assessments. With these species lists, we then evaluate 23 primer pairs commonly used in fish eDNA metabarcoding with available databases of sequence coverage and species specificity. Finally, we identify established and potentially invasive non-indigenous fish that should be prioritized for genetic sequencing to ensure robust eDNA metabarcoding for the region. Our results should increase confidence in using eDNA metabarcoding for fisheries conservation and management in the Great Lakes region and help prioritize reference sequencing efforts. The ultimate utility of eDNA metabarcoding approaches will come when conservation management of existing fish communities is integrated with early detection efforts for invasive species surveillance to assess total fish biodiversity.","[Mahon, Andrew R.] Cent Michigan Univ, Dept Biol, Mt Pleast, MI USA; [Grey, Erin K.] Univ Maine, Sch Biol & Ecol, Orono, ME USA; [Grey, Erin K.] Univ Maine, Maine Ctr Genet Environm, Orono, ME USA; [Jerde, Christopher L.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Marine Sci Inst, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA","Central Michigan University; University of Maine System; University of Maine Orono; University of Maine System; University of Maine Orono; University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara","Jerde, CL (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Marine Sci Inst, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.","cjerde@ucsb.edu","Jerde, Christopher/AAJ-4385-2020","Mahon, Andrew/0000-0002-5074-8725; Grey, Erin/0000-0001-5883-0013; Jerde, Christopher/0000-0002-8074-3466","BOEM [MC15AC00006]; NASA [NNX14AR62A]; NOAA; National Science Foundation [OIA-1849227]","BOEM; NASA(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)); NOAA(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF))","BOEM, Grant/Award Number: MC15AC00006; NASA, Grant/Award Number: NNX14AR62A; NOAA; National Science Foundation, Grant/Award Number: OIA-1849227",NA,69,4,5,6,49,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","1051-0761","1939-5582","","ECOL APPL","Ecol.

Specific objectives were to 1) determine correlations between eDNA species detections and known community composition based on conventional field sampling, 2) compare efficiency of eDNA to detect fish biodiversity among systems with variable morphologies and trophic states, and 3) determine if species habitat preferences predict eDNA detection. Location Upper Great Lakes Region, North America. Methods Fish community composition was estimated for seven lakes and two Mississippi River navigation pools using sequence data from the mitochondrial 12S gene amplified from 10 to 50 water samples per waterbody collected in 50-mL centrifuge tubes at a single time point. Environmental DNA (eDNA) was concentrated without filtration by centrifuging samples to reduce per-sample handling time. Taxonomic detections from eDNA were compared to established community monitoring databases containing up to 40 years of sampling and a detailed habitat/substrate preference matrix to identify patterns of bias. Results Mitochondrial 12S gene metabarcoding detected 15%-47% of the known species at each waterbody and 30%-76% of known genera. Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) assessment of the community structure indicated that eDNA-detected communities grouped in a similar pattern as known communities. Discriminant analysis of principal components indicated that there was a high degree of overlap in habitat/substrate preference of eDNA-detected and eDNA-undetected species suggesting limited habitat bias for eDNA sampling. Main conclusions Large numbers of small volume samples sequenced at the mitochondrial 12S gene can describe the coarse community structure of freshwater systems. However, additional conventional sampling and environmental DNA sampling may be necessary for a complete diversity census.","[Euclide, Peter T.; Larson, Wesley A.] Univ Wisconsin, Coll Nat Resources, Wisconsin Cooperat Fishery Res Unit, 800 Reserve St, Stevens Point, WI 54481 USA; [Lor, Yer; Tajjioui, Tariq; Amberg, Jon J.] US Geol Survey, Upper Midwest Environm Sci Ctr, La Crosse, WI 54603 USA; [Spear, Michael J.; Vander Zanden, Jake] Univ Wisconsin, Ctr Limnol, Madison, WI USA; [Larson, Wesley A.] Univ Wisconsin, Coll Nat Resources, US Geol Survey, Wisconsin Cooperat Fishery Res Unit, Stevens Point, WI 54481 USA; [Larson, Wesley A.] NOAA, Ted Stevens Marine Res Inst, Juneau, AK USA","University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Stevens Point; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Stevens Point; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA","Euclide, PT (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Coll Nat Resources, Wisconsin Cooperat Fishery Res Unit, 800 Reserve St, Stevens Point, WI 54481 USA.;Lor, Y (corresponding author), US Geol Survey, Upper Midwest Environm Sci Ctr, La Crosse, WI 54603 USA.","euclidp@uwm.edu; ylor@usgs.gov","Spear, Michael/R-7188-2019; van der Zanden, Joep/F-1036-2017","Euclide, Peter/0000-0002-1212-0435; Spear, Michael/0000-0002-1365-3583; Amberg, Jon/0000-0002-8351-4861; Larson, Wesley/0000-0003-4473-3401; Lor, Yer/0000-0002-5738-2412; Tajjioui, Tariq/0000-0002-0113-0451","U.S. Geological Survey Invasive Species Program; Research Computing Clusters at Old Dominion University","U.S. Geological Survey Invasive Species Program(United States Geological Survey); Research Computing Clusters at Old Dominion University","U.S. Geological Survey Invasive Species Program; Research Computing Clusters at Old Dominion University",NA,71,15,20,4,91,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","1366-9516","1472-4642","","DIVERS DISTRIB","Divers.

Existing barcode databases are biased toward cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) and frequently lack associated voucher specimens or geospatial metadata, which can hinder reliable species assignments. The emergence of metabar-coding approaches such as environmental DNA (eDNA) has necessitated multiple marker techniques combined with barcode reference databases backed by voucher specimens. Reference barcodes have traditionally been generated by Sanger sequencing, however sequencing multiple markers is costly for large numbers of specimens, requires multiple separate PCR reactions, and limits resulting sequences to targeted regions. High-throughput sequencing techniques such as genome skimming enable assembly of complete mitogenomes, which contain the most commonly used barcoding loci (e.g., COI, 12S, 16S), as well as nuclear ribosomal repeat regions (e.g., ITS1&2, 18S). We evaluated the feasibility of genome skimming to generate barcode references databases for marine fishes by assembling complete mitogenomes and nuclear ribosomal repeats. We tested genome skimming across a taxonomically diverse selection of 12 marine fish species from the collections of the National Museum of Natural History, Smithsonian Institution. We generated two sequencing libraries per species to test the impact of shearing method (enzymatic or mechanical), extraction method (kit-based or automated), and input DNA concentration. We produced complete mitogenomes for all non-chondrichthyans (11/12 species) and assembled nuclear ribosomal repeats (18S-ITS1-5.8S-ITS2-28S) for all taxa. The quality and completeness of mitogenome assemblies was not impacted by shearing method, extraction method or input DNA concentration. Our results reaffirm that genome skimming is an efficient and (at scale) cost-effective method to generate all mitochondrial and common nuclear DNA barcoding loci for multiple species simultaneously, which has great potential to scale for future projects and facilitate completing barcode reference databases for marine fishes.","[Hoban, Mykle L.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Hawaii Inst Marine Biol, Kaneohe, HI 96822 USA; [Whitney, Jonathan] NOAA, Pacific Isl Fisheries Sci Ctr, Honolulu, HI USA; [Collins, Allen G.; Reft, Abigail J.; Bemis, Katherine E.] Smithsonian Inst, NOAA Natl Systemat Lab, Nat Museum Nat Hist, Washington, DC USA; [Meyer, Christopher] Smithsonian Inst, Dept Invertebrate Zool, Natl Museum Nat Hist, Washington, DC USA; [Murphy, Katherine R.] Smithsonian Inst, Labs Analyt Biol, Natl Museum Nat Hist, Washington, DC USA","University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Smithsonian Institution; Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History; Smithsonian Institution; Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History; Smithsonian Institution; Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History","Hoban, ML (corresponding author), Univ Hawaii Manoa, Hawaii Inst Marine Biol, Kaneohe, HI 96822 USA.","mh@myklehoban.com","Hoban, Mykle/AAF-8562-2020; Collins, Allen/A-7944-2008","Collins, Allen/0000-0002-3664-9691; hoban, mykle/0000-0002-2514-3599; Bemis, Katherine/0000-0002-7471-9283; Meyer, Christopher/0000-0003-2501-7952","NOAA's Office of Science and Technology; NOAA's Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center; Cooperative Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Research; NOAA's West Hawaii Integrated Ecosystem Assessment Program; NMNH Laboratories of Analytical Biology","NOAA's Office of Science and Technology(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); NOAA's Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); Cooperative Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Research; NOAA's West Hawaii Integrated Ecosystem Assessment Program(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); NMNH Laboratories of Analytical Biology","The authors received funding support from NOAA's Office of Science and Technology, NOAA's Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center, The Cooperative Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Research, NOAA's West Hawaii Integrated Ecosystem Assessment Program, and NMNH Laboratories of Analytical Biology.

However, many species are often unaccounted for due to ineffective direct capture and visual surveys, especially in aquatic environments. Environmental DNA metabarcoding is an approach that overcomes low detection probabilities and should consequently enhance estimates of biodiversity and its proxy, species richness. Here, we synthesize 37 studies in natural aquatic systems to compare species richness estimates for bony fish between eDNA metabarcoding and conventional methods, such as nets, visual census, and electrofishing. In freshwater systems with fewer than 100 species, we found eDNA metabarcoding detected more species than conventional methods. Using multiple genetic markers further increased species richness estimates with eDNA metabarcoding. For more diverse freshwater systems and across marine systems, eDNA metabarcoding reported similar values of species richness to conventional methods; however, more studies are needed in these environments to better evaluate relative performance. In systems with greater biodiversity, eDNA metabarcoding will require more populated reference databases, increased sampling effort, and multi-marker assays to ensure robust species richness estimates to further validate the approach. eDNA metabarcoding is reliable and provides a path for broader biodiversity assessments that can outperform conventional methods for estimating species richness.","[McElroy, Mary E.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Interdept Grad Program Marine Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Dressler, Terra L.; Titcomb, Georgia C.; Eliason, Erika J.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Wilson, Emily A.] Bakersfield Coll, Biol Dept, Bakersfield, CA USA; [Deiner, Kristy] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Biogeochem & Pollutant Dynam, Zurich, Switzerland; [Dudley, Tom L.; Lafferty, Kevin D.; Love, Milton S.; Jerde, Christopher L.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Inst Marine Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Evans, Nathan T.] US Fish & Wildlife Serv, Carterville Fish & Wildlife Conservat Off, Wilmington, IL USA; [Gaines, Steven D.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Bren Sch Environm Sci & Management, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Lafferty, Kevin D.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Western Ecol Res Ctr, US Geol Survey, Inst Marine Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Lamberti, Gary A.; Pfrender, Michael E.] Univ Notre Dame, Dept Biol Sci, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA; [Li, Yiyuan] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Integrat Biol, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Lodge, David M.] Cornell Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Cornell Atkinson Ctr Sustainable Future, Ithaca, NY USA; [Mahon, Andrew R.] Cent Michigan Univ, Dept Biol, Mt Pleasant, MI 48859 USA; [Renshaw, Mark A.] Hawaii Pacific Univ, Ocean Inst, Waimanalo, HI USA; [Selkoe, Kimberly A.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Natl Ctr Ecol Anal & Synth, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA","University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara; University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara; United States Department of the Interior; US Fish & Wildlife Service; University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara; University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; University of Notre Dame; University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; Cornell University; Central Michigan University; Hawaii Pacific University; National Center for Ecological Analysis & Synthesis; University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara","Jerde, CL (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Inst Marine Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.","cjerde@ucsb.edu","Lafferty, Kevin/B-3888-2009; Titcomb, Georgia/ABF-6335-2021; Dressler, Terra/JYP-5682-2024; Gaines, Steven/Y-3234-2019; Pfrender, Micheal/C-5065-2019; Jerde, Christopher/AAJ-4385-2020; Lodge, David/AAX-1781-2021","Titcomb, Georgia/0000-0002-2206-1125; Mahon, Andrew/0000-0002-5074-8725; Gaines, Steven/0000-0002-7604-3483","NASA [NNX14AR62A]; NOAA; USAID [AID-OAA-A-00057]; DOD-SERDP [W912HG-12-C-0073 (RC-2240), W912HQ19C0064 (RC19-1004)]; BOEM [MC15AC00006]; California Regional Water Quality Control Board [16-023-140]; NFWF [57446, 55495]; NSF GRF [1650114]; NGS Early Career [EC-333R-18]; European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Program [852621]; U.S. Geological Survey Ecosystem Mission Area; European Research Council (ERC) [852621] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC)","NASA(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)); NOAA(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); USAID(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)); DOD-SERDP; BOEM; California Regional Water Quality Control Board; NFWF; NSF GRF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NGS Early Career; European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Program(European Research Council (ERC)); U.S. Geological Survey Ecosystem Mission Area; European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC))","This research was partially supported by NASA (NNX14AR62A), BOEM (MC15AC00006), NOAA's support of the Santa Barbara Channel Marine Biodiversity Observation Network, USAID (AID-OAA-A-00057), DOD-SERDP [W912HG-12-C-0073 (RC-2240) and W912HQ19C0064 (RC19-1004)], California Regional Water Quality Control Board (16-023-140), NFWF (57446 and 55495), NSF GRF (1650114) and NGS Early Career (EC-333R-18), the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Program (852621), and the U.S. Geological Survey Ecosystem Mission Area.",NA,91,71,76,4,81,"FRONTIERS MEDIA SA","LAUSANNE","AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND","2296-701X","","","FRONT ECOL EVOL","Front.

Environmental DNA (eDNA) detection techniques have been used for monitoring soft-bodied organisms (e.g., fishes) and some invertebrates, primarily in freshwater systems, but there are limited examples of eDNA as a method for monitoring marine crustaceans. The present study evaluates the efficacy of applying eDNA methods for detecting the invasive European green crab (Carcinus maenas) in a dynamic estuarine environment, and the effect of crab life stage (sex, molt stage, ovigery, abundance) on eDNA detection rates. An initial field experiment conducted in a local salt marsh system detected no C. maenas eDNA in sediment samples associated with traps containing C. maenas. In subsequent laboratory trials, aquaria containing one or two C. maenas at different life stages (soft-shell, hard-shell, male, female, ovigerous) were evaluated in replicated treatments to test the hypothesis that C. maenas exudes eDNA at higher levels when ovigerous, soft-shell, or at higher abundances. Duplicate sediment slurry and water samples were collected from each aquarium (n = 23) prior to crab addition (T-0), and after 24 h (T-1), 4 days (T-2), and 7 days (T-3). Sediment slurry and water samples were filtered, extracted, and analyzed using a species-specific droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) assay. In all non-control aquaria, C. maenas eDNA was detected, but concentrations were low (<10 copies/mu L) in non-ovigerous treatments. eDNA concentrations were significantly higher in sediment slurry versus water samples for male and ovigerous treatments. Overall, concentrations increased from T-0 to T-1 but did not significantly change from T-1 through T-3. The findings from this study indicate that during most of their life cycle, C. maenas shed low levels of DNA, highlighting the importance of considering life stage and sampling methodology when using eDNA to monitor crustaceans in estuarine environments.","[Crane, Laura C.; Goldstein, Jason S.; Rexroth, Kayla S.] Wells Natl Estuarine Res Reserve, 342 Laudholm Farm Rd, Wells, ME 04090 USA; [Thomas, Devin W.; Watts, Alison W.] Univ New Hampshire, 35 Colovos Rd, Durham, NH 03824 USA; [Rexroth, Kayla S.] Salisbury Univ, 1101 Camden Ave, Salisbury, MD 21801 USA","University System Of New Hampshire; University of New Hampshire; University System of Maryland; Salisbury University","Crane, LC (corresponding author), Wells Natl Estuarine Res Reserve, 342 Laudholm Farm Rd, Wells, ME 04090 USA.","lcrane@wellsnerr.org","","Crane, Laura/0000-0002-1465-3251; Thomas, Devin/0000-0002-0381-0434","National Estuarine Research Reserve System (NERRS) Science Collaborative - National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA); University of Michigan Water Center [NAI4NOS4190145]","National Estuarine Research Reserve System (NERRS) Science Collaborative - National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA); University of Michigan Water Center","We thank Heather Gilbert for assistance with analyses, and W.

The efficiency and outcome of these efforts are dependent upon either de novo primer design or selecting an appropriate primer set from the dozens that have already been published. Unfortunately, there is a lack of studies that have directly compared the efficacy of different metabarcoding primers in marine and estuarine systems. Here we evaluate five commonly used primer sets designed to amplify rRNA barcoding genes in fishes and compare their performance using water samples collected from estuarine sites in the highly biodiverse Indian River Lagoon in Florida. Three of the five primer sets amplify a portion of the mitochondrial 12S gene (MiFish_12S, 171bp; Riaz_12S, 106 bp; Valentini_12S, 63 bp), one amplifies 219 bp of the mitochondrial 16S gene (Berry_16S), and the other amplifies 271 bp of the nuclear 18S gene (MacDonald_18S). The vast majority of the metabarcoding reads (> 99%) generated using the 18S primer set assigned to non-target (non-fish) taxa and therefore this primer set was omitted from most analyses. Using a conservative 99% similarity threshold for species level assignments, we detected a comparable number of species (55 and 49, respectively) and similarly high Shannon's diversity values for the Riaz_12S and Berry_16S primer sets. Meanwhile, just 34 and 32 species were detected using the MiFish_12S and Valentini_12S primer sets, respectively. We were able to amplify both bony and cartilaginous fishes using the four primer sets with the vast majority of reads (>99%) assigned to the former. We detected the greatest number of elasmobranchs (six species) with the Riaz_12S primer set suggesting that it may be a suitable candidate set for the detection of sharks and rays. Of the total 76 fish species that were identified across all datasets, the combined three 12S primer sets detected 85.5% (65 species) while the combination of the Riaz_12S and Berry_16S primers detected 93.4% (71 species). These results highlight the importance of employing multiple primer sets as well as using primers that target different genomic regions.

Although most commonly used to determine species presence and measure biodiversity, eDNA approaches also hold great potential to obtain population -level genetic information from water samples. In this study, we sequenced a panel of multiallelic microsatellite markers from filtered water and fish tissue samples to uncover patterns of intraspecific diversity in the freshwater Round Goby (Neogobius melanostomus) across their invaded range in the Laurentian Great Lakes region. Although we found that the concentration of nuclear eDNA is lower than mitochondrial eDNA, we nonetheless detected over two- thirds of all nuclear alleles identified from genotyped tissues in our eDNA samples, with the greatest recovery of common alleles in the population. Estimates of allele frequencies and genetic variability within and between populations were detected from eDNA in patterns that were consistent with individual tissue -based estimates of genetic diversity and differentiation. The strongest genetic differentiation in both eDNA and tissues exists in an isolation by distance pattern. Our study demonstrates the potential for eDNA-based approaches to characterize key population parameters required to effectively monitor, manage, or sustain aquatic species.SignificanceThrough the analysis of DNA shed by organisms into their environment, environmental DNA (eDNA) sampling is a powerful and efficient approach for collecting information about species across a wide range of ecosystems. While typically used for species detections, eDNA may also provide information about population -level genetic variability. Here, we explore the potential for eDNA sampling to estimate genetic diversity and structure of an invasive fish species throughout the Great Lakes region, uncovering genetic patterns from analysis of eDNA that are consistent with conventional tissue -based estimates. This work highlights the potential for eDNA sampling to reveal detailed population characteristics that may inform monitoring and management plans for species that are difficult to sample by conventional means.","[Andres, Kara J.; Lodge, David M.; Andres, Jose] Cornell Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Andres, Kara J.] Washington Univ St Louis, Dept Biol, St Louis, MO 63130 USA; [Andres, Kara J.] Washington Univ St Louis, Living Earth Collaborat, St Louis, MO 63130 USA; [Lodge, David M.] Cornell Univ, Cornell Atkinson Ctr Sustainabil, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA","Cornell University; Washington University (WUSTL); Washington University (WUSTL); Cornell University","Andres, KJ (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.;Andres, KJ (corresponding author), Washington Univ St Louis, Dept Biol, St Louis, MO 63130 USA.;Andres, KJ (corresponding author), Washington Univ St Louis, Living Earth Collaborat, St Louis, MO 63130 USA.","akara@wustl.edu","","Andres, Kara/0000-0003-4822-7047","University of Michigan Cooperative Institute for Great Lakes Research (CIGLR) , through the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration [NA17OAR4320152]; NSF Coastal Science, Engineering, and Education for Sustainability program [1748389]; Department of Defense Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program [RC19- 1004]; Cornell Atkinson Center for Sustainability","University of Michigan Cooperative Institute for Great Lakes Research (CIGLR) , through the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); NSF Coastal Science, Engineering, and Education for Sustainability program; Department of Defense Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program(United States Department of Defense); Cornell Atkinson Center for Sustainability","Funding for this project was provided by the University of Michigan Cooperative Institute for Great Lakes Research (CIGLR) , through the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Cooperative Agreement NA17OAR4320152 (CIGLR contribution) , the NSF Coastal Science, Engineering, and Education for Sustainability program (grant number 1748389) , the Department of Defense Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program (grant number RC19- 1004) , and the Cornell Atkinson Center for Sustainability.

For eDNA metabarcoding, having a genetic reference sequence identified to fish species is vital to reduce detection errors. Detection errors will increase when there is no reference sequence for a species or when the reference sequence is the same between different species at the same sequenced region of DNA. These errors will be acute in high biodiversity systems like the Mekong River Basin, where many fish species have no reference sequences and many congeners have the same or very similar sequences. Recently developed tools allow for inspection of reference database coverage and the sequence similarity between species. These evaluation tools provide a useful pre-deployment approach to evaluate the breadth of fish species richness potentially detectable using eDNA metabarcoding. Here we combined established species lists for the Mekong River Basin, resulting in a list of 1345 fish species, evaluated the genetic library coverage across 23 peer-reviewed primer pairs, and measured the species specificity for one primer pair across four genera to demonstrate that coverage of genetic reference libraries is but one consideration before deploying an eDNA metabarcoding surveillance program. This analysis identifies many of the eDNA metabarcoding knowledge gaps with the aim of improving the reliability of eDNA metabarcoding applications in the Mekong River Basin. Genetic reference libraries perform best for common and commercially valuable Mekong fishes, while sequence coverage does not exist for many regional endemics, IUCN data deficient, and threatened fishes.","[Jerde, Christopher L.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Marine Sci Inst, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Mahon, Andrew R.; Armstrong, Madeline N.; Zehnpfennig, Jessica R.] Cent Michigan Univ, Dept Biol, Mt Pleast, MI 48859 USA; [Campbell, Teresa; Kelson, Suzanne J.; Koning, Aaron A.; Chandra, Sudeep; Hogan, Zeb S.] Univ Nevada, Dept Biol, Reno, NV 89557 USA; [Campbell, Teresa; Kelson, Suzanne J.; Koning, Aaron A.; Chandra, Sudeep; Hogan, Zeb S.] Univ Nevada, Global Water Ctr, Reno, NV 89557 USA; [McElroy, Mary E.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Interdept Grad Program Marine Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Pin, Kakada; Ngor, Peng Bun; So, Nam] Inland Fisheries Res & Dev Inst, Wonders Mekong Project, Fisheries Adm, 186 Preah Norodom Blvd,POB 582, Phnom Penh 12300, Cambodia; [Childress, Jasmine N.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Nuon, Vanna; So, Nam] Mekong River Commiss Secretariat, POB 6101,184 Fa Ngoum Rd,Unit 18, Viangchan 01000, Laos; [Nuon, Vanna] Cambodia Natl Mekong Comm, 576,Natl Rd 2, Khan Meanchey 12300, Phnom Penh, Cambodia","University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara; Central Michigan University; Nevada System of Higher Education (NSHE); University of Nevada Reno; Nevada System of Higher Education (NSHE); University of Nevada Reno; University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara; University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara","Jerde, CL (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Marine Sci Inst, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.","cjerde@ucsb.edu; mahon2a@cmich.edu; tcampbs@gmail.com; mcelroy@ucsb.edu; pin.kakada77@gmail.com; jnchildress@gmail.com; armst4m@cmich.edu; zehnp1jr@cmich.edu; skelson@unr.edu; akoning@unr.edu; pengbun.ngor@gmail.com; vannanuon88@gmail.com; sonam@mrcmekong.org; sudeep@unr.edu; zhogan@unr.edu","Campbell, Teresa/W-3935-2019; Jerde, Christopher/AAJ-4385-2020","Ngor, Peng Bun/0000-0002-3659-6577; Campbell, Teresa/0000-0002-8916-6837; Mahon, Andrew/0000-0002-5074-8725; Armstrong, Madeline/0000-0001-5866-8984; Nuon, Vanna/0000-0002-1390-9438; Childress, Jasmine/0000-0003-0423-4069; Jerde, Christopher/0000-0002-8074-3466","USAID Wonders of the Mekong Cooperative Agreement [AID-OAA-A-00057]; NASA [NNX14AR62A]; NOAA's support of the Santa Barbara Channel Marine Biodiversity Observation Network; BOEM [MC15AC00006]","USAID Wonders of the Mekong Cooperative Agreement; NASA(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)); NOAA's support of the Santa Barbara Channel Marine Biodiversity Observation Network; BOEM","This research was funded by USAID Wonders of the Mekong Cooperative Agreement (AID-OAA-A-00057 to Z.H. and S.C.).

Typically, seawater samples are obtained using Niskin bottles and filtered to collect eDNA. However, standard sample volumes are small relative to the scale of the environment, conventional collection strategies are limited, and the filtration process is time consuming. To overcome these limitations, we developed a new large - volume eDNA sampler with in situ filtration, capable of taking up to 12 samples per deployment. We conducted three deployments of our sampler on the robotic vehicle Mesobot in the Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary in the northwestern Gulf of Mexico and collected samples from 20 to 400 m depth. We compared the large volume (similar to 40-60 L) samples collected by Mesobot with small volume (similar to 2 L) samples collected using the conventional CTD rosette - mounted Niskin bottle approach. We sequenced the V9 region of 18S rRNA, which detects a broad range of invertebrate taxa, and found that while both methods detected biodiversity changes associated with depth, our large volume samples detected approximately 66% more taxa than the CTD small volume samples. We found that the fraction of the eDNA signal originating from metazoans relative to the total eDNA signal decreased with sampling depth, indicating that larger volume samples may be especially important for detecting metazoans in mesopelagic and deep ocean environments. We also noted substantial variability in biological replicates from both the large volume Mesobot and small volume CTD sample sets. Both of the sample sets also identified taxa that the other did not - although the number of unique taxa associated with the Mesobot samples was almost four times larger than those from the CTD samples. Large volume eDNA sampling with in situ filtration, particularly when coupled with robotic platforms, has great po-tential for marine biodiversity surveys, and we discuss practical methodological and sampling considerations for future applications.","[Govindarajan, Annette F.; Francolini, Rene] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Biol Dept, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; [McCartin, Luke; Herrera, Santiago] Lehigh Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Bethlehem, PA 18015 USA; [Adams, Allan] MIT, Future Ocean Lab, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Adams, Allan] Ocean Labs Res Fdn, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Adams, Allan; Allan, Elizabeth; Belani, Abhimanyu; Fujii, Justin; Gomez-Ibanez, Daniel; Kukulya, Amy; Marin, Fredrick; Tradd, Kaitlyn; Yoerger, Dana R.] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Appl Ocean Phys & Engn, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; [Allan, Elizabeth] Univ Washington, Sch Marine & Environm Affairs, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Francolini, Rene] Bigelow Lab Ocean Sci, East Boothbay, ME 04544 USA; [Francolini, Rene] Univ Maine, Darling Marine Ctr, Sch Marine Sci, Walpole, ME 04573 USA; [McDermott, Jill M.] Lehigh Univ, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Bethlehem, PA 18015 USA; [Belani, Abhimanyu] Reefgen Inc, San Francisco, CA 94124 USA","Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution; Lehigh University; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences; University of Maine System; University of Maine Orono; Lehigh University","Govindarajan, AF (corresponding author), Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Biol Dept, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.","afrese@whoi.edu","McDermott, Jill/GLN-3495-2022; Herrera, Santiago/E-5953-2011","Herrera, Santiago/0000-0001-7204-9434; Govindarajan, Annette/0000-0001-8531-5826","Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution's Ocean Twilight Zone Project; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Oceanic and Atmospheric Research, Office of Ocean Exploration and Research [NA18OAR0110289]; Future Oceans Lab Acceleration Fund; UNH [19-015]; NOAA Federal Award [NA17NOS0080203]","Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution's Ocean Twilight Zone Project; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Oceanic and Atmospheric Research, Office of Ocean Exploration and Research(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); Future Oceans Lab Acceleration Fund; UNH; NOAA Federal Award(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA)","This research is part of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution's Ocean Twilight Zone Project, funded as part of The Audacious Project housed at TED, and a result of research funded by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Oceanic and Atmospheric Research, Office of Ocean Exploration and Research, under award NA18OAR0110289 to Lehigh University (SH and JM co-PIs).

It remains unclear whether eDNA signals can provide quantitative metrics of abundance on which human livelihoods or conservation successes depend. Here, we report the results of a large eDNA ocean survey (spanning 86 000 km(2) to depths of 500 m) to understand the abundance and distribution of Pacific hake (Merluccius productus), the target of the largest finfish fishery along the west coast of the USA. We sampled eDNA in parallel with a traditional acoustic-trawl survey to assess the value of eDNA surveys at a scale relevant to fisheries management. Despite local differences, the two methods yield comparable information about the broad-scale spatial distribution and abundance.

Traditional methods such as seines and hook and line surveys are often labor intensive, taxonomically biased, and can be physically hazardous. Emerging techniques, such as baited remote underwater video (BRUV) and environmental DNA (eDNA) are promising nondestructive tools for assessing marine biodiversity in surf zones of sandy beaches. Here we compare the relative performance of beach seines, BRUV, and eDNA in characterizing community composition of bony (teleost) and cartilaginous (elasmobranch) fishes of surf zones at 18 open coast sandy beaches in southern California. Seine and BRUV surveys captured overlapping, but distinct fish communities with 50% (18/36) of detected species shared. BRUV surveys more frequently detected larger species (e.g. sharks and rays) while seines more frequently detected one of the most abundant species, barred surfperch (Amphistichus argenteus). In contrast, eDNA metabarcoding captured 88.9% (32/36) of all fishes observed in seine and BRUV surveys plus 57 additional species, including 15 that frequent surf zone habitats. On average, eDNA detected over 5 times more species than BRUVs and 8 times more species than seine surveys at a given site. eDNA approaches also showed significantly higher sensitivity than seine and BRUV methods and more consistently detected 31 of the 32 (96.9%) jointly observed species across beaches. The four species detected by BRUV/seines, but not eDNA were only resolved at higher taxonomic ranks (e.g. Embiotocidae surfperches and Sygnathidae pipefishes). In frequent co-detection of species between methods limited comparisons of richness and abundance estimates, highlighting the challenge of comparing biomonitoring approaches. Despite potential for improvement, results overall demonstrate that eDNA can provide a cost-effective tool for long-term surf zone monitoring that complements data from seine and BRUV surveys, allowing more comprehensive surveys of vertebrate diversity in surf zone habitats.","[Gold, Zachary A.; Koch, McKenzie Q.

Recent research and verified public encounter reports suggest that the core population in south and southwest Florida may be stabilizing and potentially expanding into formerly occupied areas of their historic range in the western Atlantic; however, the status of this species outside of core waters is not well understood. Environmental DNA (eDNA) methods provide a relatively cost effective and rapid assessment tool for monitoring species occurrence in aquatic habitats. Here, we have developed an eDNA tool: a species-specific Droplet Digital (TM) PCR assay targeting a 100-base pair portion of the mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 gene in P. pectinata, with the ability to reliably detect as little as 0.25 pg of target DNA. The assay was validated by analyzing a water sample from an occupied nursery in southwest Florida, which was found to contain an average of 11.54 copies of target DNA/mu L (SE = 0.72) in the reaction. The assay was then further tested by placing a juvenile sawfish in an ex situ tank and analyzing water samples collected at time intervals. The implementation of this eDNA tool into field surveys will provide additional, reliable data to assess species recovery and aid in prioritizing localities in which to focus new research, conservation, and education initiatives.","[Lehman, Ryan N.; Schweiss, Katherine E.; Phillips, Nicole M.] Univ Southern Mississippi, Sch Biol Environm & Earth Sci, Hattiesburg, MS 39406 USA; [Poulakis, Gregg R.; Scharer, Rachel M.] Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservat Commiss, Charlotte Harbor Field Lab, Fish & Wildlife Res Inst, Port Charlotte, FL 33954 USA; [Hendon, Jill M.] Univ Southern Mississippi, Ctr Fisheries Res & Dev, Ocean Springs, MS 39564 USA","University of Southern Mississippi; Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservation Commission; University of Southern Mississippi","Phillips, NM (corresponding author), Univ Southern Mississippi, Sch Biol Environm & Earth Sci, Hattiesburg, MS 39406 USA.","N.Phillips@usm.edu","Phillips, Nicole/AAC-3700-2020","Lehman, Ryan/0000-0002-3847-4004","University of Southern Mississippi; Mississippi Institutional Development Award (IDeA) Network of Biomedical Research Excellence (INBRE); Institutional Development Award (IDeA) from the National Institutes of General Medical Sciences of the National Institutes of Health [P20-GM103476]; U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) National Marine Fisheries Service through Section 6 (Cooperation with the States) of the U.S. Endangered Species Act [NA16NMF4720062]; Save Our Seas Foundation [384]","University of Southern Mississippi; Mississippi Institutional Development Award (IDeA) Network of Biomedical Research Excellence (INBRE); Institutional Development Award (IDeA) from the National Institutes of General Medical Sciences of the National Institutes of Health; U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) National Marine Fisheries Service through Section 6 (Cooperation with the States) of the U.S. Endangered Species Act; Save Our Seas Foundation","This research was funded by The University of Southern Mississippi and was supported by the Mississippi Institutional Development Award (IDeA) Network of Biomedical Research Excellence (INBRE), funded under Institutional Development Award (IDeA) number P20-GM103476 from the National Institutes of General Medical Sciences of the National Institutes of Health.

In recent years, there has been growing interest in using environmental DNA (eDNA) for marine ecosystem management and biodiversity assessment. However, the main challenge hindering eDNA applicability has been the inability to infer absolute species abundances from multispecies analysis (eDNA metabarcoding). In this study, we demonstrate a way forward by estimating the abundance of commercially important fish species in a Norwegian fjord using a joint Bayesian statistical model of traditional trawl-catch data and molecular data derived from eDNA. Using this model, we accurately predict out-of-sample trawl catches using eDNA alone. Moreover, our model provides empirical estimates for key processes linking marine eDNA concentration to the fish population abundance estimated from trawl observations, including trawl catchability, DNA shedding, degradation, dilution, transport, recovery rate, and isolation efficiency. These processes, including amplification efficiencies correcting for Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) bias, are species-specific and enable the translation of eDNA metabarcoding data into abundances. These findings have broad implications for the use of eDNA in marine ecosystem management and conservation efforts.","[Guri, Gledis; Johansen, Torild; Praebel, Kim; Hanebrekke, Tanja; Westgaard, Jon-Ivar] Norwegian Inst Marine Res, Hjalmar Johansens gate14, N-9007 Tromso, Norway; [Guri, Gledis; Praebel, Kim] UiT Arctic Univ Norway, Norwegian Coll Fishery Sci, Muninbakken 21, N-9019 Tromso, Norway; [Shelton, Andrew Olaf] NOAA Fisheries, NW Fisheries Sci Ctr, Seattle, WA 98112 USA; [Kelly, Ryan P.] Univ Washington, Sch Marine & Environm Affairs, Seattle, WA 98105 USA; [Yoccoz, Nigel] UiT Arctic Univ Norway, Dept Arctic & Marine Biol, N-9019 Tromso, Norway; [Ray, Jessica Louise] NORCE Norwegian Res Ctr, Climate & Environm Dept, Uni Res Environm, N-5020 Bergen, Norway; [Fall, Johanna] Norwegian Inst Marine Res, N-5005 Bergen, Norway","Institute of Marine Research - Norway; UiT The Arctic University of Tromso; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; UiT The Arctic University of Tromso; Norwegian Research Centre (NORCE); Institute of Marine Research - Norway","Guri, G (corresponding author), Norwegian Inst Marine Res, Hjalmar Johansens gate14, N-9007 Tromso, Norway.;Guri, G (corresponding author), UiT Arctic Univ Norway, Norwegian Coll Fishery Sci, Muninbakken 21, N-9019 Tromso, Norway.","gledis.guri@hi.no","Ray, Jessica Louise/D-2210-2018; Yoccoz, Nigel/C-8561-2014; Guri, Gledis/GWC-7856-2022","Fall, Johanna/0000-0002-6978-7986; Guri, Gledis/0000-0002-3711-6758","Project FISHDIV - Norwegian Research Council (NRC) [NRC301691]; Program Marine Ecosystem processes at Institute of Marine Research","Project FISHDIV - Norwegian Research Council (NRC); Program Marine Ecosystem processes at Institute of Marine Research","This research was supported by the project FISHDIV (NRC301691) funded by the Norwegian Research Council (NRC) and the program Marine Ecosystem processes at Institute of Marine Research.",NA,66,0,0,15,15,"OXFORD UNIV PRESS","OXFORD","GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","1054-3139","1095-9289","","ICES J MAR SCI","ICES J.

Here, UVC surveys commonly have detection probabilities (p) surpassing 0.90, providing an ideal setting to examine the performance of newer eDNA methods. We also evaluate the potential for using eDNA concentrations to predict the count of Coho Salmon within pool habitats. MethodsWe conducted paired eDNA and UVC surveys in 96 pools across 25 stream reaches within the Smith River basin, California. Method-specific p and the effect of environmental covariates were estimated using multiscale occupancy modeling. We used generalized linear models to evaluate the relationship of fish counts to eDNA concentrations and habitat covariates. ResultThe eDNA and UVC methods showed a high degree of agreement in detecting the presence of Coho Salmon within a pool (93% agreement) and survey reach (80% agreement). Detection probabilities for eDNA (peDNA) and for UVC (pUVC) were similar and high at median levels of pool residual depth and contributing basin area (peDNA = 91%, pUVC = 89%). Contributing basin area (a proxy for discharge) had a strong, negative effect that was more pronounced for peDNA than for pUVC (e.g., in the largest basins, peDNA = 34% whereas pUVC = 77%). We did not find eDNA concentrations to be a good predictor of Coho Salmon counts in small pools. ConclusionThis study demonstrates that eDNA methods yielded nearly identical results to UVC surveys in catchments <36 km2 and can provide a highly effective approach for determining the distribution of Coho Salmon. However, additional investigation is required before eDNA could be used to estimate relative abundance in small pools.","[Shaffer, Jason T.; Kinziger, Andrew P.; Buchheister, Andre] Calif State Polytech Univ Humboldt, Dept Fisheries Biol, Arcata, CA 95521 USA; [Bjorkstedt, Eric P.] Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Southwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Trinidad, CA USA","National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA","Buchheister, A (corresponding author), Calif State Polytech Univ Humboldt, Dept Fisheries Biol, Arcata, CA 95521 USA.","andre.buchheister@humboldt.edu","","","California Department of Transportation; California State University Program for Education and Research in Biotechnology; California State Parks system; [65A0762]","California Department of Transportation; California State University Program for Education and Research in Biotechnology; California State Parks system;","This work was supported, in part, by a contract from the California Department of Transportation (65A0762), the California State University Program for Education and Research in Biotechnology, and the Marin Rod and Gun Club, and it was completed in partial fulfillment of a Master of Science degree in Natural Resources by J.T.S at California State Polytechnic University Humboldt.

Beta diversity, which quantifies species turnover between these two scales, is emerging as a key driver of ecosystem function that can inform spatial conservation. Yet measuring biodiversity remains a major challenge, especially in aquatic ecosystems. Decoding environmental DNA (eDNA) left behind by organisms offers the possibility of detecting species sans direct observation, a Rosetta Stone for biodiversity. While eDNA has proven useful to illuminate diversity in aquatic ecosystems, its utility for measuring beta diversity over spatial scales small enough to be relevant to conservation purposes is poorly known. Here we tested how eDNA performs relative to underwater visual census (UVC) to evaluate beta diversity of marine communities. We paired UVC with 12S eDNA metabarcoding and used a spatially structured hierarchical sampling design to assess key spatial metrics of fish communities on temperate rocky reefs in southern California. eDNA provided a more-detailed picture of the main sources of spatial variation in both taxonomic richness and community turnover, which primarily arose due to strong species filtering within and among rocky reefs. As expected, eDNA detected more taxa at the regional scale (69 vs. 38) which accumulated quickly with space and plateaued at only similar to 11 samples. Conversely, the discovery rate of new taxa was slower with no sign of saturation for UVC. Based on historical records in the region (2000-2018) we found that 6.9 times more UVC samples would be required to detect 50 taxa compared to eDNA. Our results show that eDNA metabarcoding can outperform diver counts to capture the spatial patterns in biodiversity at fine scales with less field effort and more power than traditional methods, supporting the notion that eDNA is a critical scientific tool for detecting biodiversity changes in aquatic ecosystems.","[Lamy, Thomas; Yorke, Christie E.; Miller, Robert J.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Marine Sci Inst, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Lamy, Thomas] Univ Montpellier, CNRS, IFREMER, MARBEC,IRD, Sete, France; [Pitz, Kathleen J.; Chavez, Francisco P.] Monterey Bay Aquarium Res Inst, Moss Landing, CA 95039 USA","University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara; Ifremer; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Montpellier; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute","Lamy, T (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Marine Sci Inst, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.;Lamy, T (corresponding author), Univ Montpellier, CNRS, IFREMER, MARBEC,IRD, Sete, France.","thomas.lamy27@gmail.com","; Lamy, Thomas/K-9430-2015","Miller, Robert/0000-0002-8350-3759; Pitz, Kathleen/0000-0002-4931-8592; Lamy, Thomas/0000-0002-7881-0578","National Science Foundation's Long-Term Ecological Research program under Division of Ocean Sciences [9982105, 0620276]; NSF Bio-Ocean award [0962306]; National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Biodiversity and Ecological Forecasting Program [NNX14AR62A, NNX14AP62A]; Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Environmental Studies Program (BOEM) [MC15AC00006]; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration; David and Lucile Packard Foundation; Directorate For Geosciences [0620276, 9982105] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Directorate For Geosciences; Division Of Ocean Sciences [0962306] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Division Of Ocean Sciences [0620276, 9982105] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","National Science Foundation's Long-Term Ecological Research program under Division of Ocean Sciences; NSF Bio-Ocean award(National Science Foundation (NSF)); National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Biodiversity and Ecological Forecasting Program; Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Environmental Studies Program (BOEM); National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); David and Lucile Packard Foundation(The David & Lucile Packard Foundation); Directorate For Geosciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO)); Directorate For Geosciences; Division Of Ocean Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO)); Division Of Ocean Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO))","We thank J.

To examine the potential for eDNA to support marine fisheries monitoring surveys, we optimized an eDNA isolation method, developed a multispecies assay and tested it on eDNA samples collected along the Pacific coast of the United States. Four commercial DNA extraction kits that exploit the capability of the nucleic acids binding a solid phase (two using a silica matrix and two magnetic beads) as well an organic separation method were tested. A species-specific multiplex qPCR assay was developed and tested to simultaneously target Pacific hake (Merluccius productus), Pacific lamprey (Entosphenus tridentatus) and eulachon (Thaleichthys pacificus). The specificity of the assay was tested in silico, in vitro and in natura. Environmental DNA isolation using phenol:chloroform:isoamyl purification with a phase lock was optimized and yielded the highest amount of total and target DNA and was used to extract 46 marine water samples for the detection of the three species of interest. The multiplex qPCR assay used in the quantification process was also optimized to provide convenience and accuracy. Pacific hake was present in 44% of the eDNA samples while the other two species were absent. Here, we present a complete workflow for the simultaneous detection and quantification of multiple marine fish species using eDNA. This workflow supports large-scale at-sea sampling efforts with preservation at ambient temperatures and has demonstrated DNA extraction efficiency and reliability. The multiplex qPCR assay is shown to be sensitive and specific for the purposes of simultaneously monitoring the relative abundance of multiple targeted fish species.","[Ramon-Laca, Ana] Univ Washington, Sch Marine Environm Affairs, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Ramon-Laca, Ana; Wells, Abigail; Park, Linda] Natl Ocean & Atmospher Adm, Northwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Seattle, WA USA; [Wells, Abigail] Lynker Technol, Leesburg, VA USA","University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA","Ramn-Laca, A (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Sch Marine Environm Affairs, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.;Ramn-Laca, A (corresponding author), Natl Ocean & Atmospher Adm, Northwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Seattle, WA USA.","ana.ramon-laca@noaa.gov","","Wells, Abigail/0000-0003-4220-6763; Ramon-Laca, Ana/0000-0002-9204-6932","","","",NA,38,12,15,5,32,"PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE","SAN FRANCISCO","1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA","1932-6203","","","PLOS ONE","PLoS One","",2021,16,"9",NA,"","","",NA,NA,"e0257773","10.1371/journal.pone.0257773","http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0257773",NA,"",17,"Multidisciplinary Sciences","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Science & Technology - Other Topics","XM7DR",34570816,"gold, Green Published","","","2024-10-25","WOS:000728983400038","View Full Record in Web of Science",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In this study, we developed a workflow and portable kit for fieldable environmental DNA sequencing (FeDS) and tested its efficacy by characterizing the breadth of jellyfish (Medusozoa) taxa in the coastal waters of the Upper and Lower Florida Keys. Environmental DNA was isolated from seawater collection events at eight sites and samples were subjected to medusozoan 16S rRNA gene and metazoan mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase 1 gene profiling via metabarcoding onsite. In total, FeDS yielded 175,326 processed sequence reads providing evidence for 53 medusozoan taxa. Our most salient findings revealed eDNA from: (1) two venomous box jellyfish (Cubozoa) species, including taxa whose stings cause the notorious Irukandji envenomation syndrome; (2) two species of potentially introduced stalked jellyfish (Staurozoa); and (3) a likely cryptic species of upside-down jellyfish (Scyphozoa).

We assessed the response of steelhead Oncorhynchus mykiss (anadromous Rainbow Trout)/Rainbow Trout (hereafter, collectively referred to as O. mykiss) ) and Coastrange Sculpin Cottus aleuticus populations to major postfire debris flows in two small coastal basins of California using noninvasive environmental DNA (eDNA) sampling. Methods: We analyzed water samples from disturbed reaches for eDNA in the first two summers after debris flows. In Big Creek, all Coastrange Sculpin habitat was disturbed by debris flows, but a major tributary occupied by O. mykiss was not affected. In Mill Creek, all available habitat for both species was disturbed. We also sampled two unburned basins as undisturbed reference streams. Result: In Big Creek, O. mykiss eDNA was detected in all water samples during both years, and concentrations in some samples approached the lowest concentrations in the reference streams. Coastrange Sculpin eDNA was detected only in a single water sample in the first year and was not detected in the second year. In Mill Creek, neither species was detected in the first year, but during the second year, O. mykiss eDNA was detected at very low concentrations in 40% of samples and Coastrange Sculpin eDNA was detected in a single sample. Conclusion: Our results indicate that O. mykiss and Coastrange Sculpins either survived in or quickly reoccupied the disturbed reaches from within the basins. However, the detection rates for cases in which all habitat for a species in a basin was affected by debris flows indicate that abundances were very low, suggesting that persistence may be uncertain unless there is successful reproduction or immigration.

Hence, MCEs may serve as potential refugia for threatened shallow reefs, but they also harbour depth-endemic fauna distinct from shallow reefs. Previous studies have characterized biodiversity patterns along depth gradients, but focussed primarily on conspicuous taxa (fishes, corals, etc.). Environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding offers a more holistic approach to assess biodiversity patterns across the tree of life. Here, we use three metabarcoding assays targeting fishes (16S rRNA), eukaryotes (18S rDNA) and metazoans (COI) to assess biodiversity change from the surface to similar to 90 m depth across 15-m intervals at three sites within the Hawaiian Archipelago. We observed significant community differences between most depth zones, with distinct zonation centred at 45-60 m for eukaryotes and metazoans, but not for fishes. This finding may be attributable to the higher mobility of reef fishes, although methodological limitations are likely a contributing factor. The possibility for MCEs to serve as refugia is not excluded for fishes, but invertebrate communities >45 m are distinct, indicating limited connectivity for the majority of reef fauna. This study provides a new approach for surveying biodiversity on MCEs, revealing patterns in a much broader context than the limited-taxon studies that comprise the bulk of our present knowledge.","[Hoban, Mykle L.; Bowen, Brian W.] Hawaii Inst Marine Biol, Kaneohe, HI 96744 USA; [Bunce, Michael] Dept Conservat, Wellington, New Zealand; [Bunce, Michael] Curtin Univ, Trace & Environm DNA Lab, Perth, WA, Australia","Curtin University","Hoban, ML (corresponding author), Hawaii Inst Marine Biol, Kaneohe, HI 96744 USA.","mhoban@hawaii.edu","Hoban, Mykle/AAF-8562-2020","hoban, mykle/0000-0002-2514-3599; Bunce, Michael/0000-0002-0302-4206","For field assistance, we thank C.

Simultaneously, our coastlines are under the constant pressure of climate change which is impacting their chemical, physical and biological characteristics. It is thus pertinent to evaluate and record habitat use so we can understand how these different environments contribute to local biodiversity. This study evaluates the assemblages of fish found at five Zostera beds in Southern California using environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding. eDNA is a powerful biodiversity monitoring tool that offers key advantages to conventional monitoring. Results from our eDNA study found 78 species of fish that inhabit these five beds around Southern California representing embayment, open coastal mainland and open coastal island settings. While each bed had the same average number of species found throughout the year, the composition of these fish assemblages was strongly site dependent. There were 35 fish that were found at both open coast and embayment seagrass beds, while embayment seagrass sites had 20 unique fish and open coast sites had 23 unique fish. These results demonstrate that seagrass fish assemblages are heterogenous based on their geographic positioning and that marine managers must take this into account for holistic conservation and restoration efforts.","[Waters, Tanner; Ambrose, Richard F.; Eagle, Robert A.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Inst Environm & Sustainabil, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Waters, Tanner; Ambrose, Richard F.; Eagle, Robert A.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Ctr Div Leadership Sci, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Gold, Zachary] NOAA, Pacific Marine Environm Lab, Seattle, WA USA; [Obaza, Adam] Paua Marine Res Grp, Long Beach, CA USA; [Ambrose, Richard F.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Environm Hlth Sci, Jonathan & Karen Fielding Sch Publ Hlth, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Eagle, Robert A.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Atmospher & Ocean Sci Dept, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA","University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles","Waters, T; Eagle, RA (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Inst Environm & Sustainabil, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.;Waters, T; Eagle, RA (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Ctr Div Leadership Sci, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.;Eagle, RA (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Atmospher & Ocean Sci Dept, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.","tannerwaters@g.ucla.edu; robeagle@g.ucla.edu","; Gold, Zachary/KBA-8921-2024","Waters, Tanner/0000-0002-7013-1837; Gold, Zachary/0000-0003-0490-7630","UCLA CotaRobles Fellowship; National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship; Switzer Foundation Fellowship; UCLA Center for Diverse Leadership in Science Fellowship; Anthony & Jeanne Pritzker Family Foundation; David and Lucile Packard Foundation [2020-70931]; La Kretz Center for California Conservation Science; Stunt Ranch Santa Monica Mountains Reserve","UCLA CotaRobles Fellowship; National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Switzer Foundation Fellowship; UCLA Center for Diverse Leadership in Science Fellowship; Anthony & Jeanne Pritzker Family Foundation; David and Lucile Packard Foundation(The David & Lucile Packard Foundation); La Kretz Center for California Conservation Science; Stunt Ranch Santa Monica Mountains Reserve","TW is supported by the UCLA CotaRobles Fellowship, the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship, the Switzer Foundation Fellowship, and the UCLA Center for Diverse Leadership in Science Fellowship.

Deriving quantitative estimates of underlying biological communities from metabarcoding is critical for enhancing the utility of such approaches for health and conservation. Recent work has demonstrated that correcting for amplification biases in genetic metabarcoding data can yield quantitative estimates of template DNA concentrations. However, a major source of uncertainty in metabarcoding data stems from non-detections across technical PCR replicates where one replicate fails to detect a species observed in other replicates. Such non-detections are a special case of variability among technical replicates in metabarcoding data. While many sampling and amplification processes underlie observed variation in metabarcoding data, understanding the causes of non-detections is an important step in distinguishing signal from noise in metabarcoding studies. Here, we use both simulated and empirical data to 1) suggest how non-detections may arise in metabarcoding data, 2) outline steps to recognize uninformative data in practice, and 3) identify the conditions under which amplicon sequence data can reliably detect underlying biological signals. We show with both simulations and empirical data that, for a given species, the rate of non-detections among technical replicates is a function of both the template DNA concentration and species-specific amplification efficiency. Consequently, we conclude metabarcoding datasets are strongly affected by (1) deterministic amplification biases during PCR and (2) stochastic sampling of amplicons during sequencing-both of which we can model-but also by (3) stochastic sampling of rare molecules prior to PCR, which remains a frontier for quantitative metabarcoding. Our results highlight the importance of estimating species-specific amplification efficiencies and critically evaluating patterns of non-detection in metabarcoding datasets to better distinguish environmental signal from the noise inherent in molecular detections of rare targets.","[Gold, Zachary] UW, Cooperat Inst Climate Ocean & Ecosyst Studies, Seattle, WA 98105 USA; [Gold, Zachary; Shelton, Andrew Olaf; Gallego, Ramon J.; Van Cise, Amy; Jensen, Alexander; Ramon-Laca, Ana M.; Parsons, Kim] NOAA, Northwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, NMFS, Seattle, WA 98115 USA; [Casendino, Helen; Duprey, Joe; D'Agnese, Erin; Allan, Elizabeth Andruszkiewicz; Garber-Yonts, Maya P.; Kelly, Ryan] UW, Sch Marine & Environm Affairs, Seattle, WA USA; [Fisher, Mary] UW, Sch Aquat Fisheries Sci, Seattle, WA USA; [Labare, Michaela] UCSD, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA USA","National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of California System; University of California San Diego; Scripps Institution of Oceanography","Gold, Z (corresponding author), UW, Cooperat Inst Climate Ocean & Ecosyst Studies, Seattle, WA 98105 USA.;Gold, Z (corresponding author), NOAA, Northwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, NMFS, Seattle, WA 98115 USA.","Zachary.gold@noaa.gov","Gallego, Ramon/AAA-6840-2020; Casendino, Helen/JFJ-5407-2023; Gold, Zachary/KBA-8921-2024","Gallego, Ramon/0000-0003-4990-9648; Ramon-Laca, Ana/0000-0002-9204-6932; Gold, Zachary/0000-0003-0490-7630","Joint Institute for the Study of the Atmosphere and Ocean (JISAO) under NOAA [NA15OAR4320063]; NOAA and University of Washington; David and Lucile Packard Foundation; OceanKind","Joint Institute for the Study of the Atmosphere and Ocean (JISAO) under NOAA(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); NOAA and University of Washington(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); David and Lucile Packard Foundation(The David & Lucile Packard Foundation); OceanKind","ZG was supported by the Joint Institute for the Study of the Atmosphere and Ocean (JISAO) under NOAA Cooperative Agreement NA15OAR4320063.

Information requirements for these assessments vary by jurisdiction, but nearly all require an analysis of the biological elements of ecosystems. Amplicon-sequencing-also called metabarcoding-of environmental DNA (eDNA) has made it possible to sample and amplify the genetic material of many species present in those environments, providing a tractable, powerful, and increasingly common way of doing environmental-impact analysis for development projects. Here, we analyze an 18-month time series of water samples taken before, during, and after two culvert removals in a salmonid-bearing freshwater stream. We also sampled multiple control streams to develop a robust background expectation against which to evaluate the impact of this discrete environmental intervention in the treatment stream. We generate calibrated, quantitative metabarcoding data from amplifying the 12s MiFish mtDNA locus and complementary species-specific quantitative PCR data to yield multispecies estimates of absolute eDNA concentrations across time, creeks, and sampling stations. We then use a linear mixed effects model to reveal patterns of eDNA concentrations over time, and to estimate the effects of the culvert removal on salmonids in the treatment creek. We focus our analysis on four common salmonid species: cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii), coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch), rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), and sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka). We find that one culvert in the treatment creek seemed to have no impact while the second culvert had a large impact on fish passage. The construction itself seemed to have only transient effects on salmonid species during the two construction events. In the context of billions of dollars of court-mandated road culvert replacements taking place in Washington State, USA, our results suggest that culvert replacement can be conducted with only minimal impact of construction to key species of management concern. Furthermore, eDNA methods can be an effective and efficient approach for monitoring hundreds of culverts to prioritize culverts that are required to be replaced.

Their communities can be studied through shotgun metagenomic sequencing and bioinformatic analyses, including binning draft microbial genomes. Long-read sequencing offers the potential to improve metagenome assemblies and provide more robust assessments of microbial community composition and function than short-read sequencing. We applied Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) CCS (circular consensus sequencing) HiFi shotgun sequencing to 14 marine water column samples and compared the results with those for short-read metagenomes from the corresponding environmental DNA samples. We found that long-read metagenomes varied widely in quality and biological information. The community compositions of the corresponding long- and short-read metagenomes were frequently dissimilar, suggesting higher stochasticity and/or bias associated with PacBio sequencing. Long reads provided few improvements to the assembly qualities, gene annotations, and prokaryotic metagenome-assembled genome (MAG) binning results. However, only long reads produced high-quality eukaryotic MAGs and contigs containing complete zooplankton marker gene sequences. These results suggest that high-quality long-read metagenomes can improve marine community composition analyses and provide important insight into eukaryotic phyto- and zooplankton genetics, but the benefits may be outweighed by the inconsistent data quality.IMPORTANCE Ocean microbes provide critical ecosystem services, but most remain uncultivated. Their communities can be studied through shotgun metagenomic sequencing and bioinformatic analyses, including binning draft microbial genomes. However, most sequencing to date has been done using short-read technology, which rarely yields genome sequences of key microbes like SAR11. Long-read sequencing can improve metagenome assemblies but is hampered by technological shortcomings and high costs. In this study, we compared long- and short-read sequencing of marine metagenomes. We found a wide range of long-read metagenome qualities and minimal improvements to microbiome analyses. However, long reads generated draft genomes of eukaryotic algal species and provided full-length marker gene sequences of zooplankton species, including krill and copepods. These results suggest that long-read sequencing can provide greater genetic insight into the wide diversity of eukaryotic phyto- and zooplankton that interact as part of and with the marine microbiome.","[Patin, N.

We tested for AIS and illegal native species in 51 bait and 21 pond stores from the central Great Lakes (Lake Erie, Ohio and Lake St. Clair, Michigan) and the adjacent Wabash River (Indiana) using environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcode assays of water samples and morphological identifications. Retailers were questioned about supply chains, and anglers surveyed about baitfish use and disposal. Assays revealed unadvertised species eDNA in 100% of bait stores, with 61% containing illegal native non-bait (totaling 13 species) and 88% having AIS (11 species). Illegal native non-bait species included juvenile walleye, yellow perch, and white sucker eDNA. AIS eDNA included Eurasian ruffe in seven stores (all states), silver carp in five (including a Lake Erie store in two separate years), and bighead carp in two Lake Erie stores that also had silver carp. Among pond stores, two in Lake St. Clair had bighead carp eDNA, one also contained silver carp, and a Wabash River location showed European ide. Unadvertised invasive snails were discerned in 55% of pond stores. Four contained zebra mussel eDNA and two had invasive bryozoans. Illegal native species and AIS were widespread, but showed little relationship to the retailers' variable and extensive supply chains. Live baitfish releases were reported by 50% of Lake Erie anglers and 35% in Lake St. Clair. Consumer behavior and AIS prevalence in the bait and pond trades thus pose serious risks for introductions and spread.","[Snyder, Matthew R.; Stepien, Carol A.; Marshall, Nathaniel T.] NOAA, Genet & Genom Grp, Pacific Marine Environm Lab, 7600 Sand Point Way NE, Seattle, WA 98115 USA; [Snyder, Matthew R.; Marshall, Nathaniel T.; Scheppler, Hannah B.] Univ Toledo, Dept Environm Sci, Genet & Genom Grp, 2801 West Bancroft St, Toledo, OH 43606 USA; [Snyder, Matthew R.] Univ Washington, Joint Inst Study Atmosphere & Ocean, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Black, Christopher L.; Czajkowski, Kevin P.] Univ Toledo, Dept Geog & Planning, 2801 West Bancroft St, Toledo, OH 43606 USA","National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University System of Ohio; University of Toledo; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; University System of Ohio; University of Toledo","Stepien, CA (corresponding author), NOAA, Genet & Genom Grp, Pacific Marine Environm Lab, 7600 Sand Point Way NE, Seattle, WA 98115 USA.","Carol.Stepien@noaa.gov","Czajkowski, Krzysztof/B-8526-2019; A.Stepien, Carol/AAW-5270-2020","Marshall, Nathaniel/0000-0002-0548-4273; Czajkowski, Kevin/0000-0002-0472-4204","USEPA GLRI grants [GL-00E01149-0, GL-00E01289, GL-00E01898]; NSF Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) [DBI-1461124]; NSF [DGE-0742395]; University of Toledo; JISAO in Summer 2019","USEPA GLRI grants; NSF Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU)(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)NSF - Office of the Director (OD)); NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); University of Toledo; JISAO in Summer 2019","This study was funded by USEPA GLRI grants GL-00E01149-0 and GL-00E01289 (to CAS) and GL-00E01898 (to CAS and KPC); the latter two were partially subawarded to the University of Washington Joint Institute for the Study of the Atmosphere and Ocean (JISAO).

Here we use environmental DNA (eDNA) amplicons to analyze a broad cross-section of taxa from ecological communities in and immediately surrounding eelgrass (Zostera marina). Sampling seawater along transects extending alongshore outward from eelgrass beds, we demonstrate that eDNA provides meter-scale resolution of communities in the field. We evaluate eDNA abundance indices for 13 major phylogenetic groups of marine and estuarine taxa along these transects, finding highly local changes linked with proximity to Z. marina for a diverse group of dinoflagellates, and for no other group of taxa. Eelgrass habitat is consistently associated with dramatic reductions in dinoflagellate abundance both within the contiguous beds and for at least 15 m outside, relative to nearby sites without eelgrass. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that eelgrass-associated communities have allelopathic effects on dinoflagellates, and that these effects can extend in a halo beyond the bounds of the contiguous beds. Because many dinoflagellates are capable of forming harmful algal blooms (HABs) toxic to humans and other animal species, the apparent salutary effect of eelgrass habitat on neighboring waters has important implications for public health as well as shellfish aquaculture and harvesting.","[Jacobs-Palmer, Emily; Gallego, Ramon; Cribari, Kelly; Kelly, Ryan P.] Univ Washington, Sch Marine & Environm Affairs, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Gallego, Ramon; Ramon-Laca, Ana] NOAA, Northwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Seattle, WA USA; [Gallego, Ramon] Natl Acad Sci Engn & Med, NRC Res Associateship Program, Washington, DC USA; [Ramon-Laca, Ana] Ocean Associates Inc, Arlington, VA USA; [Kunselman, Emily] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Kunselman, Emily; Horwith, Micah] Washington State Dept Nat Resources, Olympia, WA USA","University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; National Academies of Sciences, Engineering & Medicine; University of California System; University of California San Diego; Scripps Institution of Oceanography","Jacobs-Palmer, E (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Sch Marine & Environm Affairs, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.","emjp@uw.edu","Gallego, Ramon/AAA-6840-2020","Ramon-Laca, Ana/0000-0002-9204-6932; Gallego, Ramon/0000-0003-4990-9648","Washington State Department of Natural Resources [93-096140]","Washington State Department of Natural Resources","This work was supported by the Washington State Department of Natural Resources Interagency Agreement No. 93-096140.

Several software packages exist for analyzing amplicon data, among which QIIME 2 has emerged as a popular option because of its broad functionality, plugin architecture, provenance tracking, and interactive visualizations. However, each new analysis requires the user to keep track of input and output file names, parameters, and commands; this lack of automation and standardization is inefficient and creates barriers to meta-analysis and sharing of results. Findings We developed Tourmaline, a Python-based workflow that implements QIIME 2 and is built using the Snakemake workflow management system. Starting from a configuration file that defines parameters and input files-a reference database, a sample metadata file, and a manifest or archive of FASTQ sequences-it uses QIIME 2 to run either the DADA2 or Deblur denoising algorithm; assigns taxonomy to the resulting representative sequences; performs analyses of taxonomic, alpha, and beta diversity; and generates an HTML report summarizing and linking to the output files. Features include support for multiple cores, automatic determination of trimming parameters using quality scores, representative sequence filtering (taxonomy, length, abundance, prevalence, or ID), support for multiple taxonomic classification and sequence alignment methods, outlier detection, and automated initialization of a new analysis using previous settings. The workflow runs natively on Linux and macOS or via a Docker container. We ran Tourmaline on a 16S ribosomal RNA amplicon data set from Lake Erie surface water, showing its utility for parameter optimization and the ability to easily view interactive visualizations through the HTML report, QIIME 2 viewer, and R- and Python-based Jupyter notebooks. Conclusion Automated workflows like Tourmaline enable rapid analysis of environmental amplicon data, decreasing the time from data generation to actionable results.

We conducted a series of controlled feeding experiments, with red lionfish (Pterois volitans) as predators and Gulf killifish (Fundulus grandis) as prey, designed to test the effect of digestion time (12-42 h), prey item (sample) preservation (inside versus outside stomach), and sample preparation (washed versus unwashed) on DNA barcoding classification accuracy. Competitive interactions occurred between lionfish and killifish DNA during PCR amplification when universal COI primers were utilized; thus, primers were designed that matched the same priming site in both killifish and lionfish DNA. The proportion of amplified killifish DNA relative to lionfish DNA per sample was estimated using multiplex quantitative PCR (qPCR) and shown to decrease with longer digestion times, especially when samples were retained within lionfish stomachs for preservation. The effects of digestion and preservation method on amplifiable DNA resulted in significant effects on barcoding accuracy, resulting in erroneous identification of the predator (i.e., self-DNA) for nearly 25% of samples. Removing prey from predator stomachs prior to preservation significantly increased the proportion of amplified killifish DNA from samples, and enhanced barcoding accuracy. Overall, study results have important implications for the probability of false negatives for prey items, as well as false positives for self DNA, when utilizing barcoding to characterize piscine diet. Results also highlight the need to conduct more method validation research given the increasing prevalence of DNA barcoding as a means to identify specific prey items in fish diet studies.","[Dahl, Kristen A.; Patterson, William F., III] Univ Florida, Inst Food & Agr Sci, Sch Forest Fisheries & Geomat Sci, Fisheries & Aquat Sci Program, 7922 NW 71St St, Gainesville, FL 32653 USA; [Fields, Andrew; Portnoy, David S.; Grieme, Alex] Texas A&M Univ Corpus Christi, Dept Life Sci, 6300 Ocean Dr, Corpus Christi, TX 78412 USA; [Robertson, Alison] Univ S Alabama, Sch Marine & Environm Sci, 600 Clin Dr, Mobile, AL 36688 USA; [Robertson, Alison; Lockridge, Grant] Dauphin Isl Sea Lab, 101 Bienville Blvd, Dauphin Isl, AL 36528 USA; [Dahl, Kristen A.] NOAA, Pacific Isl Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, 1845 Wasp Blvd, Honolulu, HI 96818 USA; [Grieme, Alex] Edward Via Coll Osteopath Med, Louisiana Campus,4408 Bon Aire Dr, Monroe, LA 71203 USA","State University System of Florida; University of Florida; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University Corpus Christi; University of South Alabama; Dauphin Island Sea Lab; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA","Dahl, KA (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Inst Food & Agr Sci, Sch Forest Fisheries & Geomat Sci, Fisheries & Aquat Sci Program, 7922 NW 71St St, Gainesville, FL 32653 USA.","kristen.dahl@noaa.gov","","Portnoy, David/0000-0002-8178-1018; Robertson, Alison/0000-0002-2537-0943; Lockridge, Grant/0000-0002-3754-6854; Dahl, Kristen/0000-0003-4939-1084","National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ECOHAB program [NA11NOS4780028, 992]; NSF PIRE [1743802]; Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission [FWC-16188]; Office Of Internatl Science &Engineering; Office Of The Director [1743802] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ECOHAB program(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); NSF PIRE(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Office of the Director (OD)); Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission; Office Of Internatl Science &Engineering; Office Of The Director(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Office of the Director (OD))","Funding for fish collection and fish experimental work completed by AR and GL was partially supported by the National Oceanic and At-mospheric Administration ECOHAB program through award NA11NOS4780028 (AR; publication number 992) , with graduate stu-dent effort supported by NSF PIRE (1743802) , and additional funding from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC-16188 to WFP) .

Current methods of PST detection in the region range from monitoring programs utilizing net tows to detect A. catenella to direct shellfish tissue testing via mouse bioassay (MBA) for commercial aquaculture harvest, as well as various optional testing methods for subsistence and recreational harvesters. The efficacy and feasibility of these methods vary, and they have not been directly compared in Southeast Alaska. In this study, we sought to assess and compare A. catenella and PST early detection methods to determine which can provide the most effective and accurate warning of A. catenella blooms or PST events. We found microscope counts to be variable and prone to missing lower numbers of A. catenella, which may be indicative of bloom formation. However, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) significantly correlated with microscope counts and was able to effectively detect even low numbers of A. catenella on all sampling days. Paralytic shellfish toxin concentrations measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and MBA significantly correlated with each other, qPCR, and some microscope counts. These results show that qPCR is an effective tool for both monitoring A. catenella and serving as a proxy for PSTs. Further work is needed to refine qPCR protocols in this system to provide bloom warnings on an actionable timescale for the aquaculture industry and other shellfish harvesters.

Within Decapoda, developmental stages often differ conspicuously from their adult form, representing a bizarre and mysterious world still left to be discovered. The difficulties with sampling and rearing deep-sea larvae, combined with the lack of taxonomic expertise, argues for the use of molecular methods to aid in identification. Here, we use DNA barcoding combined with morphological methods, to match larval stages with their adult counterpart from the northern Gulf of Mexico and adjacent waters. For DNA barcoding, we targeted the mitochondrial ribosomal large subunit 16S (16S) and the protein coding cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 (COI). These data were combined with previous sequences to generate phylogenetic trees that were used to identify 12 unknown larval and two juvenile species from the infraorder Caridea and the suborder Dendrobranchiata. Once identified, we provide taxonomic descriptions and illustrations alongside the current state of knowledge for all families. For many groups, larval descriptions are missing or non-existent, so this study represents a first step of many to advance deep-sea larval diversity.","[Varela, Carlos; Bracken-Grissom, Heather] Florida Int Univ, Inst Environm, Dept Biol Sci, North Miami, FL 33181 USA","State University System of Florida; Florida International University","Varela, C (corresponding author), Florida Int Univ, Inst Environm, Dept Biol Sci, North Miami, FL 33181 USA.","cvare015@fiu.edu; hbracken@fiu.edu","","Bracken-Grissom, Heather/0000-0002-4919-6679","Gulf of Mexico Research Initiative (GOMRI); National Science Foundation (NSF) Division of Environmental Biology Grant [1556059]; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) RESTORE Science Program [NA19NOS4510193]; NOAA Ocean Exploration Research (NOAA-OER) [NA170AR0110208]; Direct For Biological Sciences; Division Of Environmental Biology [1556059] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Gulf of Mexico Research Initiative (GOMRI); National Science Foundation (NSF) Division of Environmental Biology Grant(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)); National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) RESTORE Science Program; NOAA Ocean Exploration Research (NOAA-OER); Direct For Biological Sciences; Division Of Environmental Biology(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO))","This research was made possible by grants from The Gulf of Mexico Research Initiative (GOMRI), the National Science Foundation (NSF) Division of Environmental Biology Grant (#1556059 awarded to H.B.-G.), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) RESTORE Science Program (#NA19NOS4510193 to Florida International University and Nova Southeastern University) and the NOAA Ocean Exploration Research (NOAA-OER) Grant (#NA170AR0110208; awarded to S.

This review attempts to redress the imbalance by considering the status of the major cephalopod stock species and the traceability of cephalopod seafood along the trade value chain. It begins with a general overview of the most important exploited cephalopods, their stock status and their market. Four major cephalopod resources are identified: the three squid species Todarodes pacificus, Dosidicus gigas and Illex argentinus; and one species of octopus, Octopus vulgaris. The techniques and problems of stock assessment (to assess sustainability) are reviewed briefly and the problems and possible solutions for assessing benthic stock such as those of octopuses are considered. An example of a stock well managed in the long term is presented to illustrate the value of careful monitoring and management: the squid Doryteuthis gahi available in Falkland Islands waters. Issues surrounding identification, mislabelling and illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing are then reviewed, followed by a discussion of approaches and techniques of traceability as applied to cephalopods. Finally, some of the mobile apps currently available and in development for tracking seafood are compared.

Phylogenetic analyses of the rbcL gene resolved five distinct clades of Martensia from the Hawaiian Islands, of which none could be attributed to the two previously used taxonomic names for this flora (M. fragilis Harvey and M. flabelliformis Harvey ex J.Agardh). Analyses of the COI barcoding region were consistent with rbcL trends, although fewer specimens amplified and sequenced for this marker. Four rbcL clades (lineages 1-4) were distinct from each other and from other described species of Martensia based on both phylogenetic position and morphological characters, and are here described as new species: Martensia abbottiae A.R.Sherwood & S.-M. Lin sp. nov., Martensia hawaiiensis A.R.Sherwood & S.-M. Lin sp. nov., Martensia tsudae A.R.Sherwood & S.-M. Lin sp. nov., and Martensia lauhiekoeloa A.R.Sherwood & S.-M. Lin sp. nov. Lineage 5 is attributable to M. albida Y.Lee. All five species in the Hawaiian flora occur in mesophotic habitats, while M. hawaiiensis, M. tsudae, and M. albida also inhabit shallow waters of the Main Hawaiian Islands. This study provides additional support for the degree of uncharacterized biodiversity from mesophotic depths in the Hawaiian Archipelago.","[Sherwood, Alison R.; Wade, Rachael M.; Spalding, Heather L.; Smith, Celia M.] Univ Hawaii, Dept Bot, 3190 Maile Way, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Lin, Showe-Mei] Natl Taiwan Ocean Univ, Inst Marine Biol, Keelung 20224, Taiwan; [Wade, Rachael M.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Biol Sci, 3209 N Maryland Ave, Milwaukee, WI 53212 USA; [Spalding, Heather L.] Coll Charleston, Dept Biol, 66 George St, Charleston, SC 29424 USA; [Sherwood, Alison R.; Smith, Celia M.] Univ Hawaii, Marine Biol Grad Program, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Kosaki, Randall K.] NOAA, Papahanaumokuakea Marine Natl Monument, 1845 Wasp Blvd,Bldg 176, Honolulu, HI 96818 USA","University of Hawaii System; National Taiwan Ocean University; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Milwaukee; College of Charleston; University of Hawaii System; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA","Sherwood, AR (corresponding author), Univ Hawaii, Dept Bot, 3190 Maile Way, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.;Sherwood, AR (corresponding author), Univ Hawaii, Marine Biol Grad Program, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.","asherwoo@hawaii.edu","","Sherwood, Alison/0000-0001-5079-9621; Kosaki, Randall/0000-0003-1363-5702","U.S. National Science Foundation [DEB-1754117]; U.S. National Fish & Wildlife Foundation [NFWF 0810.18.059023]; NOAA Coastal Ocean Program [NA07NOS4780187, NA07NOS478190]; NOAA's Coral Reef Conservation Program through the Hawai'i Undersea Research Laboratory [NA09OAR4300219, NA05OAR4301108]; NOAA's Office of Ocean Exploration; NOAA's Undersea Research Program; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument","U.S. National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); U.S. National Fish & Wildlife Foundation; NOAA Coastal Ocean Program(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); NOAA's Coral Reef Conservation Program through the Hawai'i Undersea Research Laboratory; NOAA's Office of Ocean Exploration(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); NOAA's Undersea Research Program; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument","This work was supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation (DEB-1754117), the U.S. National Fish & Wildlife Foundation (NFWF 0810.18.059023), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument, NOAA Coastal Ocean Program (NA07NOS4780187 and NA07NOS478190 to the University of Hawai'i), NOAA's Undersea Research Program and Coral Reef Conservation Program through the Hawai'i Undersea Research Laboratory (NA09OAR4300219 and NA05OAR4301108), and NOAA's Office of Ocean Exploration.

At present, amplicon-sequencing studies-known also as metabarcoding studies, in which the primary data consist of targeted, amplified fragments of DNA sequenced from many taxa in a mixture-struggle to link genetic observations to the underlying biology in a quantitative way, but many applications require quantitative information about the taxa or systems under scrutiny. As metabarcoding studies proliferate in ecology, it becomes more important to develop ways to make them quantitative to ensure that their conclusions are adequately supported. Here we link previously disparate sets of techniques for making such data quantitative, showing that the underlying polymerase chain reaction mechanism explains the observed patterns of amplicon data in a general way. By modeling the process through which amplicon-sequence data arise, rather than transforming the data post hoc, we show how to estimate the starting DNA proportions from a mixture of many taxa. We illustrate how to calibrate the model using mock communities and apply the approach to simulated data and a series of empirical examples. Our approach opens the door to improve the use of metabarcoding data in a wide range of applications in ecology, public health, and related fields.","[Shelton, Andrew Olaf; Gold, Zachary J.; Parsons, Kim] NOAA, Conservat Biol Div, Northwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Seattle, WA 98115 USA; [Gold, Zachary J.; Jensen, Alexander J.; Ramon-Laca, Ana] Univ Washington, CICOES, Seattle, WA USA; [Gold, Zachary J.; Jensen, Alexander J.; Ramon-Laca, Ana] Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Northwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Seattle, WA USA; [Jensen, Alexander J.; Agnese, Erin D.; Allan, Elizabeth Andruszkiewicz; Gallego, Ramon; Ramon-Laca, Ana; Garber-Yonts, Maya; Kelly, Ryan P.] Univ Washington, Sch Marine & Environm Affairs, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Van Cise, Amy] NOAA, North Gulf Ocean Soc, Northwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Seattle, WA USA; [Gallego, Ramon] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Dept Biol, Unidad Genet, Madrid, Spain","National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Autonomous University of Madrid","Shelton, AO (corresponding author), NOAA, Conservat Biol Div, Northwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Seattle, WA 98115 USA.","ole.shelton@noaa.gov","Gallego, Ramon/AAA-6840-2020; Gold, Zachary/KBA-8921-2024","Gold, Zachary/0000-0003-0490-7630; Jensen, Alexander/0000-0002-2911-8884; Ramon-Laca, Ana/0000-0002-9204-6932; , Andrew/0000-0002-8045-6141; Gallego, Ramon/0000-0003-4990-9648","","","",NA,56,48,51,10,54,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","0012-9658","1939-9170","","ECOLOGY","Ecology","FEB",2023,104,"2",NA,"","","",NA,NA,"e3906","10.1002/ecy.3906","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecy.3906",NA,"DEC 2022",18,"Ecology","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Environmental Sciences & Ecology","8C2WJ",36320096,"Green Published, Green Submitted","","","2024-10-25","WOS:000901933200001","View Full Record in Web of Science",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The marine zooplankton assemblage, including only metazoans, is highly diverse and taxonomically complex, with an estimated similar to 28,000 species of 41 major taxonomic groups. This review provides a comprehensive summary of DNA sequences for the barcode region of mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (COI) for identified specimens. The foundation of this summary is the MetaZooGene Barcode Atlas and Database (MZGdb), a new open-access data and metadata portal that is linked to NCBI GenBank and BOLD data repositories. The MZGdb provides enhanced quality control and tools for assembling COI reference sequence databases that are specific to selected taxonomic groups and/or ocean regions, with associated metadata (e.g., collection georeferencing, verification of species identification, molecular protocols), and tools for statistical analysis, mapping, and visualization. To date, over 150,000 COI sequences for similar to 5600 described species of marine metazoan plankton (including holo- and meroplankton) are available via the MZGdb portal. This review uses the MZGdb as a resource for summaries of COI barcode data and metadata for important taxonomic groups of marine zooplankton and selected regions, including the North Atlantic, Arctic, North Pacific, and Southern Oceans. The MZGdb is designed to provide a foundation for analysis of species diversity of marine zooplankton based on DNA barcoding and metabarcoding for assessment of marine ecosystems and rapid detection of the impacts of climate change.","[Bucklin, Ann] Univ Connecticut, Dept Marine Sci, 1080 Shennecossett Rd, Groton, CT 06340 USA; [Peijnenburg, Katja T.

Genome skimming (or low-coverage genome sequencing) is a promising method to not only extract high-copy loci but also 100s to 1000s of phylogenetically informative nuclear loci (e.g., ultraconserved elements [UCEs] and exons) from contemporary and museum samples. The subphylum Anthozoa, including important ecosystem engineers (e.g., stony corals, black corals, anemones, and octocorals) in the marine environment, is in critical need of phylogenetic resolution and thus might benefit from a genome-skimming approach. We conducted genome skimming on 242 anthozoan corals collected from 1886 to 2022. Using existing target-capture baitsets, we bioinformatically obtained UCEs and exons from the genome-skimming data and incorporated them with data from previously published target-capture studies. The mean number of UCE and exon loci extracted from the genome skimming data was 1837 +/- 662 SD for octocorals and 1379 +/- 476 SD loci for hexacorals. Phylogenetic relationships were well resolved within each class. A mean of 1422 +/- 720 loci was obtained from the historical specimens, with 1253 loci recovered from the oldest specimen collected in 1886. We also obtained partial to whole mitogenomes and nuclear rRNA genes from >95% of samples. Bioinformatically pulling UCEs, exons, mitochondrial genomes, and nuclear rRNA genes from genome skimming data is a viable and low-cost option for phylogenetic studies. This approach can be used to review and support taxonomic revisions and reconstruct evolutionary histories, including historical museum and type specimens.","[Quattrini, Andrea M.; Horowitz, Jeremy; Wirshing, Herman H.; Bowers, Hailey; Gonzalez-Garcia, Maria del P.; Sei, Makiri; Herrera, Santiago] Smithsonian Inst, Dept Invertebrate Zool, Natl Museum Nat Hist, 10th St & Constitut Ave NW, Washington, DC 20560 USA; [McCartin, Luke J.; Herrera, Santiago] Lehigh Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Bethlehem, PA 18015 USA; [Easton, Erin E.] Univ Texas Rio Grande Valley, Sch Earth Environm & Marine Sci, Port Isabel, TX 78578 USA; [Mitchell, Kenneth; McFadden, Catherine S.] Harvey Mudd Coll, Dept Biol, Claremont, CA 91711 USA; [Gonzalez-Garcia, Maria del P.] Univ Puerto Rico, Dept Marine Sci, Mayaguez, PR 00709 USA","Smithsonian Institution; Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History; Lehigh University; University of Texas System; University of Texas Rio Grande Valley; Claremont Colleges; Harvey Mudd College; University of Puerto Rico; University of Puerto Rico Mayaguez","Quattrini, AM (corresponding author), Smithsonian Inst, Dept Invertebrate Zool, Natl Museum Nat Hist, 10th St & Constitut Ave NW, Washington, DC 20560 USA.","quattrinia@si.edu","Horowitz, Jeremy/ABI-3694-2020; Easton, Erin/IQW-7835-2023; Herrera, Santiago/E-5953-2011","Quattrini, Andrea/0000-0002-4247-3055; Mitchell, Kenneth/0009-0000-6564-0349; Easton, Erin/0000-0003-4853-6026","NOAA's National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science, Competitive Research Program; Office of Ocean Exploration and Research; RESTORE Science Program [NA18NOS4780166, NA18OAR0110289, NA17NOS4510096]; DEEPSEARCH program; U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM), Environmental Studies Program, Washington, DC [M17PC00009]; NOAA Ocean Exploration; NOAA Fisheries; Smithsonian Women's Committee [OCE-1756381]; Cnidarian Tree of Life project [NSF EF-0531779]; Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute [2022-IC-010]; NOAA OE, NOAA Office of Education Educational Partnership Program with Minority Serving Institutions [NA16SEC4810009, NA21SEC4810004]; Smithsonian Institution","NOAA's National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science, Competitive Research Program(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); Office of Ocean Exploration and Research; RESTORE Science Program; DEEPSEARCH program; U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM), Environmental Studies Program, Washington, DC; NOAA Ocean Exploration(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); NOAA Fisheries(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); Smithsonian Women's Committee; Cnidarian Tree of Life project; Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute(Smithsonian InstitutionSmithsonian Tropical Research Institute); NOAA OE, NOAA Office of Education Educational Partnership Program with Minority Serving Institutions; Smithsonian Institution(Smithsonian Institution)","Gulf of Mexico collections were funded by NOAA's National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science, Competitive Research Program, the Office of Ocean Exploration and Research, and the RESTORE Science Program under awards NA18NOS4780166, NA18OAR0110289, and NA17NOS4510096 to PI S.

However, the larvae of stomatopods are more easily obtained due to their pelagic habitat, and have been the focus of recent studies of diversity. Studies of morphological diversity describe both conserved and divergent traits in larval stomatopods, but generally cannot be linked to a particular species. Conversely, genetic studies of stomatopod larvae using DNA barcoding can be used to estimate species diversity, but are generally not linked to known species by analyses of morphological characters. Here we combine these two approaches, larval morphology and genetics, to estimate stomatopod species diversity in the Hawaiian Islands. Over 22 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were identified genetically, corresponding to 20 characterized morphological types. Species from three major superfamilies of stomatopod were identified: Squilloidea (4 OTUs, 3 morphotypes), Gonodactyloidea (9, 8), and Lysiosquilloidea (6, 7). Among these, lysiosquilloids were more diverse based on larval morphotypes and OTUs as compared to previously documented Hawaiian species (3), while squilloids had a lower diversity of species represented by collected larvae as compared to the seven species previously documented. Two OTUs / morphotypes could not be identified to superfamily as their molecular and morphological features did not closely match any available information, suggesting they belong to poorly sampled superfamilies. The pseudosquillid, Pseudosquillana richeri, was discovered for the first time from HawaiModified Letter Turned Commai. This study contributes an updated estimate for Hawaiian stomatopod diversity for a total of 24 documented species, provides references for identification of larval stomatopods across the three major superfamilies, and emphasizes the lack of knowledge of species diversity in more cryptic stomatopod superfamilies, such as Lysiosquilloidea.","[Steck, Mireille; Winnicki, Elizabeth; Porter, Megan L.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Sch Life Sci, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Kobayashi, Donald R.; Whitney, Jonathan L.] NOAA, Pacific Isl Fisheries Sci Ctr, Honolulu, HI USA; [Ahyong, Shane T.] Australian Museum Res Inst, 1 William St, Sydney, NSW 2010, Australia; [Ahyong, Shane T.] Univ New South Wales, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia","University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Australian Museum; University of New South Wales Sydney","Steck, M (corresponding author), Univ Hawaii Manoa, Sch Life Sci, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.","steck4@hawaii.edu","","Winnicki, Elizabeth/0000-0002-7850-0553; Ahyong, Shane/0000-0002-2820-4158","NSF [IOS 2019355]; NOAA's West Hawaii Integrated Ecosystem Assessment; NOAA's Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center","NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NOAA's West Hawaii Integrated Ecosystem Assessment; NOAA's Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center","We would like to thank the collectors of the unique Hawaiian stomatopod adult species: Kirsten Carlson for her collection of Oratosquillina fabricii larvae/post-larvae and Molly Timmers for providing us with an adult Parvisquilla sinuosa from Hawaiian waters.

However, CCRA taxa have historically been overlooked in floristic and ecological studies because of their high degrees of phenotypic plasticity and morphological convergence that impede reliable identifications based on morphology. This study provides an update of the CCRA diversity of Guam (Mariana Islands) based on a recent DNA barcoding effort. This account of CCRA taxa is compared to (1) the most current species inventories for Guam based on morphological identifications and (2) similar floristic accounts of CCRA from other regions using DNA barcoding. 492 CCRA specimens were collected from Guam for which two markers, COI-5P and psbA, were used for phylogenetic analysis and species delimitation. Phylogenetic relationships were inferred using maximum likelihood. Species richness estimates were obtained through a conservative approach using the Automatic Barcode Gap Discovery method for species delimitation. A total of 154 putative CCRA species were identified, with 106 representatives of the subclass Corallinophycidae and 48 belonging to the order Peyssonneliales. When compared to previous studies based on morphological identification, molecular data suggests that all but one of the CCRA species reported for Guam were incorrectly identified and CCRA species richness is more than six times higher than previously assumed. Species accumulation curves show that CCRA species richness will continue to rise with increased sampling effort and the exploration of new (micro)habitats before reaching a plateau. Guam's true CCRA richness might eventually exceed the currently reported species richness of all marine red algae for the island. Of the 154 putative species documented in this study, only ten closely match (>= 98% COI-5P sequence similarity) previously described species, implying that many are probably new species to science. The here-reported CCRA diversity for Guam as a small, remote tropical island in the Western Pacific Ocean is greater than those of well-documented CCRA floras for much larger nearshore ecosystems in Brazil and New Zealand, emphasizing the value of tropical islands as hotspots of marine biodiversity.","[Mills, Matthew S.; Deinhart, Mari E.; Heagy, Mackenzie N.; Schils, Tom] Univ Guam, Marine Lab, Mangilao, GU 96923 USA; [Mills, Matthew S.] Univ Sunshine Coast, Sch Sci Technol & Engn, Sippy Downs, Qld, Australia","University of Guam; University of the Sunshine Coast","Mills, MS (corresponding author), Univ Guam, Marine Lab, Mangilao, GU 96923 USA.;Mills, MS (corresponding author), Univ Sunshine Coast, Sch Sci Technol & Engn, Sippy Downs, Qld, Australia.","Matthew.Mills@research.usc.edu.au","","Deinhart, Mari/0000-0002-3563-2329; Mills, Matthew S./0000-0001-5596-6935","National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA); National Science Foundation (NSF) [80NSSC17M0052, OIA-1946352]; NOAA Office of Sea Grant, Department of Commerce; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) [NA14OAR4170116]","National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)); National Science Foundation (NSF)(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NOAA Office of Sea Grant, Department of Commerce(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA)","This research is based upon work supported by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA; nasa.gov) and the National Science Foundation (NSF; nsf.gov) under grant numbers 80NSSC17M0052 and OIA-1946352 awarded to TS and managed through the Guam EPSCoR offices of NASA and NSF.

However, taxa identifications produced through metabarcoding require sophisticated processing of high-throughput sequencing data from taxonomically informative DNA barcodes. Various sets of universal and taxon-specific primers have been developed, extending the usability of metabarcoding across archaea, bacteria and eukaryotes. Accordingly, a multitude of metabarcoding data analysis tools and pipelines have also been developed. Often, several developed workflows are designed to process the same amplicon sequencing data, making it somewhat puzzling to choose one among the plethora of existing pipelines. However, each pipeline has its own specific philosophy, strengths and limitations, which should be considered depending on the aims of any specific study, as well as the bioinformatics expertise of the user.

A collaborative effort is underway to evaluate strategies that mitigate the spread of SCTLD across coral colonies and reefs, including restoration of disease-resistant genotypes, genetic rescue, and disease intervention with therapeutics. We conducted an in-situ experiment in Southeast Florida to assess molecular responses among SCTLD-affected Montastraea cavernosa pre- and post-application of the most widely used intervention method, CoreRx Base 2B with amoxicillin. Through Tag-Seq gene expression profiling of apparently healthy, diseased, and treated corals, we identified modulation of metabolomic and immune gene pathways following antibiotic treatment. In a complementary ex-situ disease challenge experiment, we exposed nursery-cultured M. cavernosa and Orbicella faveolata fragments to SCTLD-affected donor corals to compare transcriptomic profiles among clonal individuals from unexposed controls, those exposed and displaying disease signs, and corals exposed and not displaying disease signs. Suppression of metabolic functional groups and activation of stress gene pathways as a result of SCTLD exposure were apparent in both species. Amoxicillin treatment led to a 'reversal' of the majority of gene pathways implicated in disease response, suggesting potential recovery of corals following antibiotic application. In addition to increasing our understanding of molecular responses to SCTLD, we provide resource managers with transcriptomic evidence that disease intervention with antibiotics appears to be successful and may help to modulate coral immune responses to SCTLD. These results contribute to feasibility assessments of intervention efforts following disease outbreaks and improved predictions of coral reef health across the wider Caribbean.","[Studivan, Michael S.; Eckert, Ryan J.; Shilling, Erin; Voss, Joshua D.] Florida Atlantic Univ, Harbor Branch Oceanog Inst, Ft Pierce, FL USA; [Studivan, Michael S.; Soderberg, Nash] Univ Miami, Cooperat Inst Marine & Atmospher Studies, Miami, FL 33146 USA; [Studivan, Michael S.; Soderberg, Nash; Enochs, Ian C.] NOAA, Atlantic Oceanog & Meteorol Lab, Ocean Chem & Ecosyst Div, Miami, FL USA; [Shilling, Erin] Texas State Univ, Dept Biol, San Marcos, TX USA","Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institute Foundation; State University System of Florida; Florida Atlantic University; University of Miami; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Atlantic Oceanographic & Meteorological Laboratory (AOML); Texas State University System; Texas State University San Marcos","Studivan, MS (corresponding author), Univ Miami, Cooperat Inst Marine & Atmospher Studies, Miami, FL 33146 USA.","studivanms@gmail.com","; Eckert, Ryan/R-5600-2018; Enochs, Ian/B-8051-2014","Studivan, Michael/0000-0002-3771-0415; Eckert, Ryan/0000-0002-3010-9395; Shilling, Erin/0000-0003-1026-6892; Voss, Joshua/0000-0002-0653-2767; Soderberg, Nash/0000-0002-3155-4167; Enochs, Ian/0000-0002-8867-0361","Florida Department of Environmental Protection [B55008]; NOAA Coral Reef Conservation Program [31252]; NOAA OAR 'Omics","Florida Department of Environmental Protection; NOAA Coral Reef Conservation Program(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); NOAA OAR 'Omics(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA)","Florida Department of Environmental Protection, Grant/Award Number: B55008; NOAA Coral Reef Conservation Program, Grant/Award Number: 31252; NOAA OAR 'Omics",NA,103,3,3,4,13,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","0962-1083","1365-294X","","MOL ECOL","Mol.

Due to difficulties obtaining samples from the deep sea (> 200 m), these methods have been less frequently applied to deep-water taxa. We used DNA-barcoding techniques to enhance large-scale biodiversity initiatives for deep-pelagic crustaceans within the Gulf of Mexico, a region that has recently been identified as one of the world's four most hyperdiverse ocean ecosystems. This study was conceptualized in direct response to the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill in 2010, which identified major knowledge gaps in our understanding of deep-sea biodiversity. We employed traditional Sanger sequencing and a genomic skimming approach to target the mitochondrial ribosomal large subunit 16S and the protein-coding cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 (COI). Alongside these molecular approaches, traditional taxonomic investigations allowed for advancements in biodiversity, evolutionary relationships, cryptic species complexes, and distributional records across four abundant and common deep-pelagic orders (Amphipoda, Euphausiacea, Lophogastrida, and Decapoda). DNA barcodes were successfully obtained from 82 species for a total of 158 and 169 new 16S and COI sequences, respectively. Evidence of cryptic diversity has been found in the genera Eucopia Dana, 1852 (Lophogastrida) and Allosergestes Judkins & Kensley, 2008 ( Decapoda). New records for the Gulf of Mexico of species of Lanceola Say, 1818 (Amphipoda), Eupasiphae Wood-Mason in Wood-Mason & Alcock, 1893, Pasiphaea Savigny, 1816, and Meningodora Smith, 1882 (Caridea) are presented. Preliminary results allow us to reconsider the current classification and evolutionary relationships of several lineages. The urgency to document biodiversity in the deep-pelagic is pressing against a backdrop of future threats including oil spills and deep-sea drilling.","[Varela, Carlos; Golightly, Charles; Timm, Laura E.; Wilkins, Blake; Collins, Stormie B.; Bracken-Grissom, Heather D.] Florida Int Univ, Inst Environm, North Miami, FL 33181 USA; [Varela, Carlos; Golightly, Charles; Timm, Laura E.; Wilkins, Blake; Collins, Stormie B.; Bracken-Grissom, Heather D.] Florida Int Univ, Dept Biol Sci, North Miami, FL 33181 USA; [Timm, Laura E.] Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Dept Fisheries, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA; [Frank, Tamara] Nova Southeastern Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Ft Lauderdale, FL 33314 USA; [Fenolio, Dante] San Antonio Zoo, Ctr Conservat & Res, San Antonio, TX 78212 USA","State University System of Florida; Florida International University; State University System of Florida; Florida International University; University of Alaska System; University of Alaska Fairbanks; Nova Southeastern University","Varela, C (corresponding author), Florida Int Univ, Inst Environm, North Miami, FL 33181 USA.;Varela, C (corresponding author), Florida Int Univ, Dept Biol Sci, North Miami, FL 33181 USA.","cvare015@fiu.edu","Frank, Tamara/W-8662-2019","Collins, Stormie/0000-0002-3514-0973; Golightly, Charles/0000-0001-6256-9153; Varela, Carlos/0000-0003-3293-7562; Timm, Laura E/0000-0002-7285-0261; Frank, Tamara/0000-0002-9329-2414; Bracken-Grissom, Heather/0000-0002-4919-6679","Gulf of Mexico Research Initiative (GOMRI); National Science Foundation Division of Environmental Biology [1556059]; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Ocean Exploration Research (NOAA-OER) [NA170AR0110208]; RESTORE project; Florida Institute of Oceanography Shiptime Funding; Division Of Environmental Biology; Direct For Biological Sciences [1556059] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Gulf of Mexico Research Initiative (GOMRI); National Science Foundation Division of Environmental Biology(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)); National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Ocean Exploration Research (NOAA-OER); RESTORE project; Florida Institute of Oceanography Shiptime Funding; Division Of Environmental Biology; Direct For Biological Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO))","The authors thank the Deep-Pelagic Nekton Dynamics of the Gulf of Mexico (DEEPEND) research consortium, especially our fierce leader Tracey Sutton.

In the northern Gulf of Mexico (GoMx), MCEs are rocky reefs with abundant black corals and octocorals, including the species Swiftia exserta. Surveys following the Deepwater Horizon (DWH) oil spill in 2010 revealed significant injury to these and other species, the restoration of which requires an in-depth understanding of the biology, ecology, and genetic diversity of each species. To support a larger population connectivity study of impacted octocorals in the GoMx, this study combined sequences of mtMutS and nuclear 28S rDNA to confirm the identity of Swiftia sea fans in the GoMx, compare these markers for different polyp colors in the GoMx and Atlantic, and examine the phylogeny of the genus. Two mtMutS haplotypes were identified, one seemingly endemic to the northern GoMx. Compared to other North Atlantic Swiftia, S. exserta, the type of the genus was found to be extremely divergent and distinct from the two other Swiftia at both loci, with strong evidence of polyphyly in the genus. This information refines our understanding of the geographical distribution of injured coral and highlights how little is known about MCEs. Substantial taxonomic revisions may be needed for several taxa injured by the DWH oil spill.","[Frometa, Janessy] CSS Dynamac Inc, 10301 Democracy Lane,Suite 300, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Frometa, Janessy; Etnoyer, Peter J.; Greig, Thomas W.] NOAA, Hollings Marine Lab, Natl Ctr Coastal Ocean Sci, Natl Ocean Serv, 331 Ft Johnson Rd, Charleston, SC 29412 USA; [Quattrini, Andrea M.] Smithsonian Inst, Dept Invertebrate Zool, Natl Museum Nat Hist, 10th & Constitut Ave NW, Washington, DC 20560 USA; [Herrera, Santiago] Lehigh Univ, Dept Biol Sci, 111 Res Dr, Bethlehem, PA 18015 USA","Consolidated Safety Services, Inc.

Reported here is a baseline study of a suite of host-specific FIB microbial source tracking (MST) markers in the coastal shoreline and reef waters around the island of Saipan. Three sampling campaigns were conducted in September 2017, March 2018, and August 2018. Samples were collected from the nearshore surface waters of Saipan, the reef waters of Saipan Lagoon, and groundwater from beaches along the Saipan Lagoon shoreline. Measurements of submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) into nearshore waters and isotopic source tracking of nitrogen inputs were conducted concurrently with MST. Environmental DNA was extracted from the samples and analyzed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) for MST gene markers of fecal Bacteroidales specifically associated with humans, dogs, cows, and pigs, and for an MST gene marker of Catellicoccus associated with seabirds. MST assessments were combined with local knowledge, assessments of sanitary infrastructure, and routine watershed surveys. This study identified hotspots of human FIB along the western Saipan Lagoon shoreline in both surface waters and groundwater, plus another hotspot of human FIB at a popular tourist bathing area known as the Grotto. FIB hotspots on the Lagoon shoreline coincided with areas of high SGD and nitrogen isotopic data indicating sewage-derived N inputs. It appears that faulty sanitary infrastructure may be contributing to inputs to Saipan Lagoon, while bather shedding is likely a primary input for the Grotto area. Moderate levels of dog fecal contamination were common and widespread across the island. High levels of seabird fecal contamination were more random, both spatially and temporally, and mostly concentrated along the less developed northeast region of Saipan. No significant levels of cow or pig fecal marker were detected in coastal water samples. This study provides demonstration and establishment of analytical capacity to resource management in CNMI for MST technology to aid in trouble-shooting water quality issues involving land-based sources of microbial contaminants to CNMI coastal waters.","[Sinigalliano, Christopher; Gidley, Maribeth; Bonacolta, Anthony; Lee, Hyo Won] NOAA, Atlantic Oceanog & Meteorol Lab, Miami, FL 33149 USA; [Kim, Kiho; Knee, Karen] Amer Univ, Dept Environm Sci, Washington, DC 20016 USA; [Gidley, Maribeth; Bonacolta, Anthony; Lee, Hyo Won] Univ Miami, Cooperat Inst Marine & Atmospher Studies, Miami, FL USA; [Yuknavage, Kathy; Palacios, Dean; Bautista, Charito; Maurin, Larry] Commonwealth Northern Mariana Isl, Bur Environm & Coastal Qual, Water Qual Surveillance Nonpoint Source Program, Saipan, CM USA","National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Atlantic Oceanographic & Meteorological Laboratory (AOML); American University; University of Miami","Sinigalliano, C (corresponding author), NOAA, Atlantic Oceanog & Meteorol Lab, Miami, FL 33149 USA.","Christopher.Sinigalliano@noaa.gov","gidley, maribeth/B-8335-2014; Bonacolta, Anthony/JCE-6385-2023; Sinigalliano, Christopher/A-8760-2014","Sinigalliano, Christopher/0000-0002-9942-238X; Bonacolta, Anthony/0000-0003-1439-5907","NOAA's Coral Reef Conservation Program (CRCP) [31184]; NOAA 'Omics Initiative Program; US EPA","NOAA's Coral Reef Conservation Program (CRCP); NOAA 'Omics Initiative Program; US EPA(United States Environmental Protection Agency)","This study was funded by NOAA's Coral Reef Conservation Program (CRCP Project #31184 to CS and MG) and by the NOAA `Omics Initiative Program (to CS and MG).

The Indonesian archipelago sits at the center of the Coral Triangle, extending over several biogeographic regions with unique benthic communities, where the extent of non-native species presence is largely unknown. It is also at the center of maritime traffic between Australasia and Asia, and therefore at risk of introduction of species that are carried on the hulls and ballast water of vessels. In the present study, we aimed to raise awareness on marine biological invasions across the Indonesian archipelago by fostering discussions among scientists, educating science students, generating media articles for the public and actively involving island communities. We also aimed to test the suitability of a range of methods commonly used in bioinvasion research (settlement arrays, DNA barcoding and environmental DNA metabarcoding, vessel surveys) to establish a baseline for biofouling species and potential threats, while developing much needed capacity for monitoring and application to other areas. We recorded 66 different non-coral specimens in the fouling communities of a remote group of islands of the Indonesian archipelago, represented mainly by the taxa Porifera, Tunicata and Mollusca, which are known to include notorious invasive species. None of the identified species was known to be invasive in the region but several were cryptogenic and/or were considered to have a very broad global distribution range that can potentially include part, or all, of the Indonesian archipelago. One species, the ascidian Didemnum molle, was found to quickly settle and spread on available blank substrates. While settlement plates (monitored every 5 months) proved suitable for early detection of potential incursions of these organisms, benthic surveys, DNA barcoding and eDNA metabarcoding provide valuable complementary baseline biodiversity information. A combination of sampling methods is therefore recommended for similar studies in understudied high biodiversity areas. Results from vessel surveys highlights the importance of civil society education in helping prevent bioinvasions. This study represents the first marine biological invasions baseline, awareness and capacity development training carried in the Indonesian archipelago. The lessons taken from the variety of methods explored in a simultaneously scientific and educational setting should prove useful and motivate similar work in other areas of the world.","[Huhn, Mareike; Madduppa, Hawis H.; Khair, Miftahul; Sabrian, Amri; Irawati, Yulina; Anggraini, Nurlita Putri] IPB Univ, Inst Pertanian Bogor, Fac Fisheries & Marine Sci, Dept Marine Sci & Technol, Bogor 16680, Indonesia; [Huhn, Mareike] Ruhr Univ Bochum, Dept Gen Zool & Neurobiol, D-44780 Bochum, Germany; [Wilkinson, Shaun P.] Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Biol Sci, POB 600, Wellington, New Zealand; [Simpson, Tiffany] Curtin Univ, Dept Environm & Agr, Trace & Environm DNA TrEnD Lab, Perth, WA 6027, Australia; [Iwasaki, Kazuma; Setiamarga, Davin H.

This is especially worrying for the Caribbean branching coralAcropora palmatawhich has already seen an 80% decrease in cover primarily due to disease. Despite the importance of this keystone species, there has yet to be a characterization of its transcriptomic response to disease exposure. In this study we provide the first transcriptomic analysis of 12A.palmatagenotypes and their symbiont Symbiodiniaceae exposed to disease in 2016 and 2017. Year was the primary driver of gene expression variance forA.palmataand the Symbiodiniaceae. We hypothesize that lower expression of ribosomal genes in the coral, and higher expression of transmembrane ion transport genes in the Symbiodiniaceae indicate that a compensation or dysbiosis may be occurring between host and symbiont. Disease response was the second driver of gene expression variance forA.palmataand included a core set of 422 genes that were significantly differentially expressed. Of these, 2 genes (a predicted cyclin-dependent kinase 11b and aspartate 1-decarboxylase) showed negative Log2 fold changes in corals showing transmission of disease, and positive Log2 fold changes in corals showing no transmission of disease, indicating that these may be important in disease resistance. Co-expression analysis identified two modules positively correlated to disease exposure, one enriched for lipid biosynthesis genes, and the other enriched in innate immune genes. The hub gene in the immune module was identified as D-amino acid oxidase, a gene implicated in phagocytosis and microbiome homeostasis. The role of D-amino acid oxidase in coral immunity has not been characterized but could be an important enzyme for responding to disease. Our results indicate thatA.palmatamounts a core immune response to disease exposure despite differences in the disease type and virulence between 2016 and 2017. These identified genes may be important for future biomarker development in this Caribbean keystone species.","[Young, Benjamin D.; Traylor-Knowles, Nikki] Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Dept Marine Biol & Ecol, 4600 Rickenbacker Causeway, Miami, FL 33149 USA; [Serrano, Xaymara M.] NOAA, Atlantic Oceanog & Meteorol Lab, Miami, FL 33149 USA; [Serrano, Xaymara M.; Rosales, Stephanie M.; Williams, Dana] Univ Miami, Cooperat Inst Marine & Atmospher Studies, Miami, FL USA; [Miller, Margaret W.; Williams, Dana] NOAA, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Southeast Fisheries Sci Ctr, Miami, FL USA; [Miller, Margaret W.] SECORE Int, Miami, FL USA","University of Miami; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Atlantic Oceanographic & Meteorological Laboratory (AOML); University of Miami; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA","Traylor-Knowles, N (corresponding author), Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Dept Marine Biol & Ecol, 4600 Rickenbacker Causeway, Miami, FL 33149 USA.","ntraylorknowles@rsmas.miami.edu","Rosales, Stephanie/Z-4923-2019; Traylor-Knowles, Nikki/D-4354-2012","Young, Benjamin/0000-0002-5195-9399","NOAA's Coral Reef Conservation Program (CRCP) [S8KMCRPP00, ID31194]; OAR NOAA omics initiative","NOAA's Coral Reef Conservation Program (CRCP)(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); OAR NOAA omics initiative(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA)","NOAA's Coral Reef Conservation Program (CRCP) Project/Task#S8KMCRPP00, ID31194, and the OAR NOAA omics initiative.

These factors can promote gene flow that makes it difficult to disentangle intra- vs. inter-specific levels of genetic differentiation. Here, we assess the relationship of two istiophorid billfishes, white marlin (Kajikia albida) and striped marlin (K. audax), presently considered sister species inhabiting separate ocean basins. Previous studies report levels of genetic differentiation between these species that are smaller than those observed among populations of other istiophorid species. To determine whether white marlin and striped marlin comprise separate species or populations of a single globally distributed species, we surveyed 2520 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 62 white marlin and 242 striped marlin across the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian oceans. Multivariate analyses resolved white marlin and striped marlin as distinct groups, and a species tree composed of separate lineages was strongly supported over a single lineage tree. Genetic differentiation between white marlin and striped marlin (F-ST = 0.5384) was also substantially larger than between populations of striped marlin (F-ST = 0.0192-0.0840), and we identified SNPs that allow unambiguous species identification. Our findings indicate that white marlin and striped marlin comprise separate species, which we estimate diverged at approximately 2.38 Mya.","[Mamoozadeh, N.

Here, we use genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism data to investigate whether gene flow directionality in two seahorses (Hippocampus) and three pipefishes (Syngnathus) follows the predominant ocean circulation patterns in the Gulf of Mexico and northwestern Atlantic. In addition, we explore whether gene flow magnitudes are predicted by traits related to active dispersal ability and habitat preference. We inferred demographic histories of these co-distributed syngnathid species, and coalescent model-based estimates indicate that gene flow directionality is in agreement with ocean circulation data that predicts eastward and northward macro-algal transport. However, the magnitude to which ocean currents influence this pattern appears strongly dependent on the species-specific traits related to rafting propensity and habitat preferences. Higher levels of gene flow and stronger directionality are observed in Hippocampus erectus, Syngnathus floridae and Syngnathus louisianae, which closely associated with the pelagic macro-algae Sargassum spp., compared to Hippocampus zosterae and the Syngnathus scovelli/Syngnathus fuscus sister-species pair, which prefer near shore habitats and are weakly associated with pelagic Sargassum.

This article compares the advantages of the macro-phyte and artificial substrate methods and discusses which method is more appropriate for use in monitoring programs that focus on toxic BHAB species identification and quantification. The concept of benthic dinofla-gellate preference for specific macrophytes was also reviewed. Examination of data from 75 field studies showed macrophytes with higher surface area per unit biomass harbored higher concentrations of Gambierdiscus cells. There was no definitive evidence that cells were actively selecting one macrophyte over another. This observation supports the use of artificial substrates (AS) as a means of assessing cell abundances in complex habitats because cell counts are normalized to a standardized surface area, not macrophyte biomass. The arti-ficial substrate method represents the most robust approach, currently available, for collecting toxic, benthic dinoflagellates for a cell-based early warning system.","[Tester, Patricia A.] Ocean Tester LLC, 295 Dills Point Rd, Beaufort, NC 28516 USA; [Litaker, R.

Lampreys display extensive diversity in morphology and life history strategy. The extent of this diversity and the underlying genetic patterns have not yet been fully characterized. Uncertainty about species boundaries and operational taxonomic units hinders lamprey management and conservation. Limited data have been collected on California lampreys (Lampetra spp. and Entosphenus spp.), but evidence suggests widespread population decline across the west coast of North America. Study objectives were to identify which nominal species are present at study sites across northern and central California, determine whether current taxonomic classifications accurately and sufficiently describe lamprey diversity in California, and characterize the biogeographic distribution of genetically distinct lamprey lineages across the study area.Methods: To achieve these objectives, this study utilized DNA barcoding, phylogenetic analysis, and species delimitation analysis. Lamprey individuals (N = 87) from 19 sites in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River basin, San Francisco Bay, and Klamath River basin were sequenced for the mitochondrial cytochrome b (cyt b) gene, and the data were combined with publicly available lamprey cyt b sequences for analysis.Result: Results showed relatively deep phylogenetic divergence between Lampetra and Entosphenus. Distinct and genetically divergent lineages were observed within Lampetra, while distinct but genetically similar lineages were observed within Entosphenus. This study revealed novel Lampetra lineages in the Napa River and Alameda Creek, and results suggest that the biogeographic distribution of lamprey diversity may follow patterns observed in other native fishes. Species delimitation results indicated that at least seven separate candidate species of Lampetra can be found in California, suggesting that California holds more species-level diversity than the expected three nominal Lampetra species known to occur in the state.Conclusion: These results highlight the underestimated diversity of lampreys in California and the need for further assessment of taxonomic classifications and operational taxonomic unit designations of California lampreys.","[Auringer, Grace; Campbell, Matthew A.; Finger, Amanda J.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Anim Sci, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Campbell, Matthew A.] Univ Alaska Museum North, Fishes & Marine Invertebrates, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA; [Goertler, Pascale A.

Prior research has shown that inshore adult O. faveolata populations in the Florida Keys are able to maintain high coral cover and recover from bleaching faster than their offshore counterparts. However, whether this origin-specific variation in thermal resistance is heritable remains unclear. To address this knowledge gap, we produced purebred and hybrid larval crosses from O. faveolata gametes collected at two distinct reefs in the Upper Florida Keys, a nearshore site (Cheeca Rocks, CR) and an offshore site (Horseshoe Reef, HR), in two different years (2019, 2021). We then subjected these aposymbiotic larvae to severe (36(degrees)C) and moderate (32(degrees)C) heat challenges to quantify their thermal tolerance. Contrary to our expectation based on patterns of adult thermal tolerance, HR purebred larvae survived better and exhibited gene expression profiles that were less driven by stress response under elevated temperature compared to purebred CR and hybrid larvae. One potential explanation could be the compromised reproductive output of CR adult colonies due to repeated summer bleaching events in 2018 and 2019, as gametes originating from CR in 2019 contained less storage lipids than those from HR. These findings provide an important counter-example to the current selective breeding paradigm, that more tolerant parents will yield more tolerant offspring, and highlight the importance of adopting a holistic approach when evaluating larval quality for conservation and restoration purposes.","[Zhang, Yingqi; Elder, Holland; Kenkel, Carly D.] Univ Southern Calif, Dept Biol Sci, 3616 Trousdale Pkwy, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Gantt, Shelby E.; Keister, Elise F.; Kemp, Dustin W.] Univ Alabama Birmingham, Dept Biol, Birmingham, AL 35294 USA; [Kolodziej, Graham; Aguilar, Catalina; Studivan, Michael S.] Univ Miami, Cooperat Inst Marine & Atmospher Studies, Miami, FL USA; [Kolodziej, Graham; Aguilar, Catalina; Studivan, Michael S.; Enochs, Ian C.] NOAA, Ocean Chem & Ecosyst Div, Atlantic Oceanog & Meteorol Lab, Miami, FL USA; [Williams, Dana E.] NOAA, Populat & Ecosyst Monitoring Div, Southeast Fisheries Sci Ctr, Miami, FL USA; [Manzello, Derek P.] US Natl Ocean & Atmospher Adm, Coral Reef Watch, Satellite Oceanog & Climatol Div, Ctr Satellite Applicat & Res, College Pk, MD USA","University of Southern California; University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Birmingham; University of Miami; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Atlantic Oceanographic & Meteorological Laboratory (AOML); National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA","Zhang, YQ (corresponding author), Univ Southern Calif, Dept Biol Sci, 3616 Trousdale Pkwy, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.","yingqizh@usc.edu","Aguilar, Catalina/V-7757-2019; Kolodziej, Graham/A-3034-2017; Enochs, Ian/B-8051-2014; zhang, ying/HPC-0477-2023; Manzello, Derek/A-8661-2014","Zhang, Yingqi/0000-0003-2040-7986; Williams, Dana/0000-0002-9660-5359; Manzello, Derek/0000-0002-0720-3041; Aguilar, Catalina/0000-0002-4843-0187; Gantt, Shelby/0000-0002-7340-8037; Elder, Holland/0000-0001-8432-4632","NOAA; NOAA OAR Omics Program; University of Southern California","NOAA(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); NOAA OAR Omics Program(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); University of Southern California","This project was supported by the NOAA OAR Omics Program through an award to D.

Six Bathyraja species are considered valid in the eastern North Pacific, including: B. abyssicola, B. aleutica, B. kincaidii, B. microtrachys, B. spinosissima, and B. trachura. Similar to other skate genera, eastern North Pacific Bathyraja lack a robust species-specific identification, which leads to issues with setting catch limits and creating management plans. This study identifies and formally redescribes the eastern North Pacific softnose skate species based on morphometric and meristic measurements and includes an Alaskan species, Bering Skate, B. interrupta due to its close morphological relationship to B. kincaidii. A lectotype for B. interrupta is designated. Multivariate tests determined that significant differences existed between the study species. Parsimonious phylogenetic trees showed that B kincaidii represents the basal condition, with B. abyssicola and B. aleutica being the most derived species in the study. The formerly synonymized species B. interrupta and B. kincaidii were shown to be separate, as were the previously synonymized species B. microtrachys and B. trachura. Improved Bathyraja species identification will hopefully assist fisheries managers in developing conservation policies easing the impacts of deep-sea fishing expansion.","[Knuckey, James D.

These studies match their sequencing results against public genomic databases to identify the species. However, mitochondrial genomic reference data are yet incomplete, only a few genes may be available, or the suitability of existing sequence data is suboptimal for species level resolution. Here, we present a dedicated and cost-effective workflow with no DNA amplification for generating complete fish mitogenomes for the purpose of strengthening fish mitochondrial databases. Two different strategies using long fragment sequencing with Oxford Nanopore technology coupled with mitochondrial DNA enrichment were used. One where the enrichment is achieved by preferential isolation of mitochondria followed by DNA extraction and nuclear DNA depletion (mitoenrichment). A second enrichment approach takes advantage of the CRISPR Cas9 targeted scission on previously dephosphorylated DNA (targeted mitosequencing). The sequencing results varied between tissue, species, and integrity of the DNA. The mitoenrichment method yielded 0.17%-12.33% of sequences on target and a mean coverage ranging from 74.9 to 805-fold. The targeted mitosequencing experiment from native genomic DNA yielded 1.83%-55% of sequences on target and a 38 to 2123-fold mean coverage. These produced complete mitogenomes of species with homopolymeric regions, tandem repeats, and gene rearrangements. We demonstrate that deep sequencing of long fragments of native fish DNA can be achieved with low computational resources in a cost-effective manner, opening the discovery of mitogenomes of nonmodel or understudied fish taxa to a broad range of laboratories worldwide.","[Ramon-Laca, Ana] Univ Washington, CICOES, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Ramon-Laca, Ana] Northwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Seattle, WA 98112 USA; [Ramon-Laca, Ana] CSIC, Museo Nacl Ciencias Nat, Madrid, Spain; [Gallego, Ramon; Nichols, Krista M.] NOAA, Conservat Biol Div, Northwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Seattle, WA USA; [Gallego, Ramon] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Fac Ciencias, Dept Biol, Madrid, Spain","University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Museo Nacional de Ciencias Naturales (MNCN); National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Autonomous University of Madrid","Ramn-Laca, A (corresponding author), Univ Washington, CICOES, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.;Ramn-Laca, A (corresponding author), Northwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Seattle, WA 98112 USA.","analaca@mncn.csic.es","Gallego, Ramon/AAA-6840-2020","Gallego, Ramon/0000-0003-4990-9648; Ramon-Laca, Ana/0000-0002-9204-6932","","","",NA,66,6,6,0,10,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","1755-098X","1755-0998","","MOL ECOL RESOUR","Mol.

In many organisms modular synthases occur as discrete synthetic genes or domains within a gene that act in coordination thus forming a module that produces a particular fragment of a natural product. The modules usually occur in tandem as gene clusters with a syntenic arrangement that is often predictive of the resultant structure. Dinoflagellate genomes however are notoriously complex with individual genes present in many tandem repeats and very few synthetic modules occurring as gene clusters, unlike what has been seen in bacteria and fungi. However, modular synthesis in all organisms requires a free thiol group that acts as a carrier for sequential synthesis called a thiolation domain. We scanned 47 dinoflagellate transcriptomes for 23 modular synthase domain models and compared their abundance among 10 orders of dinoflagellates as well as their co-occurrence with thiolation domains. The total count of domain types was quite large with over thirty-thousand identified, 29 000 of which were in the core dinoflagellates. Although there were no specific trends in domain abundance associated with types of toxins, there were readily observable lineage specific differences. The Gymnodiniales, makers of long polyketide toxins such as brevetoxin and karlotoxin had a high relative abundance of thiolation domains as well as multiple thiolation domains within a single transcript. Orders such as the Gonyaulacales, makers of small polyketides such as spirolides, had fewer thiolation domains but a relative increase in the number of acyl transferases. Unique to the core dinoflagellates, however, were thiolation domains occurring alongside tetratricopeptide repeats that facilitate protein-protein interactions, especially hexa and hepta-repeats, that may explain the scaffolding required for synthetic complexes capable of making large toxins. Clustering analysis for each type of domain was also used to discern possible origins of duplication for the multitude of single domain transcripts. Single domain transcripts frequently clustered with synonymous domains from multi-domain transcripts such as the BurA and ZmaK like genes as well as the multi-ketosynthase genes, sometimes with a large degree of apparent gene duplication, while fatty acid synthesis genes formed distinct clusters. Surprisingly the acyl-transferases and ketoreductases involved in fatty acid synthesis (FabD and FabG, respectively) were found in very large clusters indicating an unprecedented degree of gene duplication for these genes. These results demonstrate a complex evolutionary history of core dinoflagellate modular synthases with domain specific duplications throughout the lineage as well as clues to how large protein complexes can be assembled to synthesize the largest natural products known.","[Williams, Ernest P.; Bachvaroff, Tsvetan R.; Place, Allen R.] Univ Maryland, Ctr Environm Sci, Inst Marine & Environm Technol, 701 East Pratt St, Baltimore, MD 21202 USA","University System of Maryland; University of Maryland Baltimore; University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science; Institute of Marine & Environmental Technology","Williams, EP (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Ctr Environm Sci, Inst Marine & Environm Technol, 701 East Pratt St, Baltimore, MD 21202 USA.","williamse@umces.edu","Place, Allen/F-9267-2013","Williams, Ernest/0000-0001-8727-4968; Bachvaroff, Tsvetan/0000-0003-3800-9214","NOAA [NOS-NCCOS-2012-2002987]","NOAA(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA)","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was funded in part by a grant from NOAA-NOS-NCCOS-2012-2002987 to A.

Improvements in sensors, sampling platforms, information systems, and collaborations among experts and information users now enables more effective and up-to-date information to meet regional and national needs. Specifically, advances in environmental DNA (eDNA)-based assessments of biodiversity, community science data, various underwater imaging devices, and environmental, behavioral, and physiology observations from animal telemetry provide new opportunities to address multiple requirements for reporting status and trends, including insights into life in the deep ocean. Passive and active acoustic sensors help monitor marine life, boat traffic, and noise pollution. Satellites provide repeated, frequent, and long-term records of many relevant variables from global to local scales and, when combined with numerical computer simulations, allow planning for future scenarios. Metadata standards facilitate the transfer of data from machine to machine, thus streamlining assessments and forecasting and providing knowledge directly to the public. The Marine Biodiversity Observation Network (MBON) facilitates this exchange of information on life in the sea. The collaborative efforts of the Central and Northern California Ocean Observing System (CeNCOOS) of the US Integrated Ocean Observing System and its partners provide an example of a regional MBON process for information delivery. This includes linking policy and management needs, prioritizing observing data from various platforms and methods, streamlining data handling practices, and delivering information for management such as for the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary and the California Current Large Marine Ecosystem, with iterative process adaptation.","[Ruhl, Henry A.; Harper, Alexandra R.; Daniel, Patrick] CeNCOOS, Moss Landing, CA 95039 USA; [Ruhl, Henry A.] Monterey Bay Aquarium Res Inst MBARI, Moss Landing, CA 95039 USA; [Brown, Jennifer A.] ECOS Consulting LLC, Lafayette, CA USA; [Brown, Jennifer A.] Natl Ocean & Atmospher Adm NOAA, Monterey, CA USA; [Brown, Jennifer A.] Natl Marine Sanctuary MBNMS, Monterey, CA USA; [Hazen, Elliott L.] NOAA, Southwest Fisheries Sci Ctr SWFSC, Monterey, CA USA; [Dewitt, Lynn] NOAA, SWFSC, Santa Cruz, CA USA; [Daniel, Patrick; Ryan, John P.; Chavez, Francisco P.] MBARI, Moss Landing, CA USA; [DeVogelaere, Andrew] NOAA, MBNMS, Monterey, CA USA; [Kudela, Raphael M.; Fischer, Alexis D.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz UCSC, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Fischer, Alexis D.] Univ Corp Atmospheric Res, Boulder, CO 80307 USA; [Fischer, Alexis D.] NOAA, Northwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Seattle, WA USA; [Muller-Karger, Frank E.] Univ S Florida, Coll Marine Sci, IMaRS, St Petersburg, FL USA","Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of California System; University of California Santa Cruz; National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; State University System of Florida; University of South Florida","Ruhl, HA (corresponding author), CeNCOOS, Moss Landing, CA 95039 USA.;Ruhl, HA (corresponding author), Monterey Bay Aquarium Res Inst MBARI, Moss Landing, CA 95039 USA.","hruhl@mbari.org","Fischer, Alexis/M-4531-2019; Hazen, Elliott/G-4149-2014","","project National Marine Sanctuaries as Sentinel Sites for a Demonstration Marine Biodiversity Observation Network (Sanctuaries MBON) (NASA) through the National Ocean Partnership Program (NOPP) [NNX14AP62A]; project The CeNCOOS MBON: Integrating remote sensing, in situ data and models to understand central California ecosystem responses to environmental change (NASA Grant) through the National Ocean Partnership Program (NOPP) [80NSSC20M0001]; project Implementing a Marine Biodiversity Observation Network (MBON) in South Florida to Advance Ecosystem-Based Management (NASA Grant) through the National Ocean Partnership Program (NOPP) [80NSSC20K0017]; project Implementing a Marine Biodiversity Observation Network (MBON) in South Florida to Advance Ecosystem-Based Management (ONR/NOAA/US IOOS grant) through the National Ocean Partnership Program (NOPP) [NA19NOS0120199]","project National Marine Sanctuaries as Sentinel Sites for a Demonstration Marine Biodiversity Observation Network (Sanctuaries MBON) (NASA) through the National Ocean Partnership Program (NOPP); project The CeNCOOS MBON: Integrating remote sensing, in situ data and models to understand central California ecosystem responses to environmental change (NASA Grant) through the National Ocean Partnership Program (NOPP); project Implementing a Marine Biodiversity Observation Network (MBON) in South Florida to Advance Ecosystem-Based Management (NASA Grant) through the National Ocean Partnership Program (NOPP); project Implementing a Marine Biodiversity Observation Network (MBON) in South Florida to Advance Ecosystem-Based Management (ONR/NOAA/US IOOS grant) through the National Ocean Partnership Program (NOPP)","This work was made possible in part by efforts of NOAA, including the Integrated Ecosystem Assessment, the Office of National Marine Sanctuaries, the National Marine Fisheries Service, Integrated Ocean Observing System, and Marine Biodiversity Observation Network.

Blade quality can be compromised by attached organisms - epibionts. Biweekly examination of epibionts on sugar kelp was conducted April-May 2018, on a kelp farm in eastern Long Island Sound, CT, USA. Culturable Vibrio spp. were not present on kelp blades until May and were limited to only old sections. No Vibrio colonies were human pathogens V. parahaemolyticus or V. vulnificus, based upon ToxR-specific multiplex PCR assays. Neither epibenthic cyanobacteria Lyngbya spp. nor the dinoflagellate Prorocentrum lima, microbes of concern because of toxigenicity, were detected on kelp by microscopy or metabarcoding of partial rRNA genes. The lacy bryozoan was the only epibiotic animal observed that could cause damage to kelp, but its abundance was low.Summarizing most-common sequence reads, Gammaproteobacteria was the most abundant bacterial group on kelp blades (49%) and Alphaproteobacteria were the most abundant in seawater (39%). Bacillariophyta were the most abundant eukaryotes on kelp blades (36%) and Dinoflagellata were the most abundant eukaryotes in seawater (43%). Molecular operational taxonomic unit matrices were used for non-metric multidimensional scaling; the most prominent structure for both prokaryotic and eukaryotic communities was the separation between blade and seawater samples. This spatial separation explained 81% and 76% of the variation among prokaryotic and eukaryotic samples, respectively. Indicator Species Analysis identified Gammaproteobacteria (55%) and Bacillariophyta (56%) to be the most important blade indicator prokaryotes and eukaryotes, respectively. A closer examination of indicator species temporal patterns and their ecophysiology suggested that Aquimarina, Parcubacteria, and Peronosporomycetes are potential pathogens to sugar kelp. Ciliates may be the most important grazers that keep epiphytes (Bacillariophyta, Rhodophyta, and Phaeophyta) and Peronosporomycetes on kelp in check.","[Liu, Yuan] AIS Inc, N Dartmouth, MA 02747 USA; [Liu, Yuan; Wikfors, Gary H.; Clark, Paul; Pitchford, Steven; Krisak, Melissa; Dixon, Mark S.; Li, Yaqin] NOAA, Milford Lab, Northweast Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Milford, CT USA","National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA","Liu, Y (corresponding author), AIS Inc, N Dartmouth, MA 02747 USA.","yuan.liu@noaa.gov; gary.wikfors@noaa.gov; paul.clark@noaa.gov; mark.dixon@noaa.gov","","Liu, Yuan/0000-0002-4741-8100","NOAA Fisheries Office of Aquaculture; National Marine Fisheries Service Omics Strategic Initiative; Northeast Fisheries Science Center","NOAA Fisheries Office of Aquaculture(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); National Marine Fisheries Service Omics Strategic Initiative; Northeast Fisheries Science Center","This project was funded by the NOAA Fisheries Office of Aquaculture, the National Marine Fisheries Service `Omics Strategic Initiative, and the Northeast Fisheries Science Center.

This behavior is termed diel vertical migration. Migrating animals graze on phytoplankton or zooplankton and in turn serve as food for higher trophic levels, hence providing a key mechanism for carbon export via this migration. These animals are often observed as sound-scattering layers by echosounders, but the animals causing the acoustic scattering are difficult to identify using acoustics alone. In a spring 2019 experiment in Monterey Bay, we deployed autonomous underwater and surface vehicles over a seabed-mounted upward-looking echosounder to collect environmental DNA (eDNA) with the goal of identifying the vertically migrating animals. The echosounder was installed at 890-m depth on the Monterey Accelerated Research System (MARS) seabed cabled ocean observatory, providing realtime data of acoustic backscatter from the full water column. One long-range autonomous underwater vehicle (LRAUV) carrying a Third-Generation Environmental Sample Processor (3G-ESP) acquired water samples from a sequence of layers from near surface down to similar to 290 m as directed by the distribution of animals observed by the echosounder. During the sampling of each layer, the LRAUV ran on a tight circular yo-yo trajectory directly above the echosounder, remaining in its beam by acoustically tracking a station-keeping Wave Glider on the sea surface marking the echosounder's latitude and longitude. The persistent and simultaneous acoustic observation and eDNA acquisition enables identification of animals at precise locations to better understand their vertical migration behaviors. We present the methods and the system performance in the experiment.","[Zhang, Yanwu; Kieft, Brian; Hobson, Brett W.; Raanan, Ben-Yair; Pitz, Kathleen J.; Preston, Christina M.; Roman, Brent; Benoit-Bird, Kelly J.; Birch, James M.; Chavez, Francisco P.; Scholin, Christopher A.] Monterey Bay Aquarium Res Inst, Moss Landing, CA 95039 USA; [Urmy, Samuel S.] NOAA, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Alaska Fisheries Sci Ctr, Seattle, WA 98115 USA","Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA","Zhang, YW (corresponding author), Monterey Bay Aquarium Res Inst, Moss Landing, CA 95039 USA.","yzhang@mbari.org","","Benoit-Bird, Kelly J./0000-0002-5868-0390","David and Lucile Packard Foundation","David and Lucile Packard Foundation(The David & Lucile Packard Foundation)","This work was supported by the David and Lucile Packard Foundation.",NA,25,8,8,2,28,"IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC","PISCATAWAY","445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","0364-9059","1558-1691","","IEEE J OCEANIC ENG","IEEE J.

However, its performance typically depends on the availability of a substantial volume of accurately labeled data. Several active learning approaches have been proposed to reduce the labeling dependency based on the confidence of the detector. Nevertheless, these approaches tend to exhibit biases toward high-performing classes, resulting in datasets that do not adequately represent the testing data. In this study, we introduce a comprehensive framework for active learning that considers both the uncertainty and the robustness of the detector, ensuring superior performance across all classes. The robustness-based score for active learning is calculated using the consistency between an image and its augmented version. Additionally, we leverage pseudo-labeling to mitigate potential distribution drift and enhance model performance. To address the challenge of setting the pseudo-labeling threshold, we introduce an adaptive threshold mechanism. This adaptability is crucial, as a fixed threshold can negatively impact performance, particularly for low-performing classes or during the initial stages of training. For our experiment, we employ the Southeast Area Monitoring and Assessment Program Dataset 2021 (SEAMAPD21), comprising 130 fish species classes with 28,328 image samples. The results show that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art method and significantly reduces the annotation cost. Furthermore, we benchmark our model's performance against a public dataset (PASCAL VOC07), showcasing its effectiveness in comparison to existing methods.","[Nabi, M.

In EM work conducted by the Center for Fisheries Electronic Monitoring at Mote (CFEMM) in the Gulf of Mexico commercial reef fish fishery, there was a need to improve upon current technologies to enhance camera views for accurate species identification of large sharks, particularly those that were released while underwater at the vessel side or underneath the hull. This paper describes how this problem was addressed with the development of the first known EM system integrated underwater camera (UCAM) with a specialized vessel-specific deployment device on a bottom longline reef fish vessel. Data are presented based on blind video reviews from CFEMM trained reviewers of the resulting UCAM video footage compared with video from only the overhead EM cameras from 68 gear retrievals collected from eight fishing trips. Results revealed that the UCAM was a successful tool for capturing clear underwater video footage of released large (>2m) sharks to enable reviewers to improve individual species identification, determination, and fate by 34.4%. This was particularly important for obtaining data on incidental catches of large protected shark species. It also provided clear underwater imagery of the presence of potential predators such as marine mammals close to the vessel, more specifically bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) during gear retrieval, which often damaged or removed catch. This information is intended to assist researchers in need of gathering critical data on bycatch in close proximity to a vessel in which conventional overhead EM cameras are limited.","[Neidig, Carole; Lee, Max; Patrick, Genevieve] Mote Marine Lab, Ctr Fisheries Elect Monitoring, Sarasota, FL 34236 USA; [Schloesser, Ryan] Mote Marine Lab, Fisheries Ecol & Enhancement, Sarasota, FL USA; [Patrick, Genevieve] WSP USA, Tampa, FL USA","Mote Marine Laboratory & Aquarium; Mote Marine Laboratory & Aquarium","Neidig, C (corresponding author), Mote Marine Lab, Ctr Fisheries Elect Monitoring, Sarasota, FL 34236 USA.","cneidig@mote.org","",", Carole/0000-0002-2721-9526","National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration; UCAM","National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); UCAM","This study would not have been possible without the contributions of exceptional CFEMM volunteer citizen scientists, with particular recognition of Joe Gill for his unwavering enthusiasm and substantial dedication to the development of the UCAM, conducting extensive field testing, and adeptly coordinating with vessel captains and crew.

We suggest this type of system functions well when (1) the management advisory board is provided compelling rationale for engagement; (2) the process uses key individuals as communicators; (3) the research team thoughtfully selects organizations and individuals involved; (4) the funding entity provides logistical support and allows for (5) a flexible structure that prioritizes management needs; (6) a bridging organization sustains communication between in-person meetings; and (7) the project team determines and enacts a project endpoint.

We used pooled whole genome sequencing, gene annotation, and environmental covariates to evaluate patterns of genomic differentiation and to investigate mechanisms responsible for divergence among proximate Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus) populations from the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands and more distant Washington Coast cod. Samples were taken from eight spawning locations, three of which were replicated to estimate consistency in allele frequency estimation. A kernel smoothing moving weighted average of relative divergence (F-ST) identified 11 genomic islands of differentiation between the Aleutian Islands and Bering Sea samples. In some islands of differentiation, there was also elevated absolute divergence (d(XY)) and evidence for selection, despite proximity and potential for gene flow. Similar levels of absolute divergence (d(XY)) but roughly double the relative divergence (F-ST) were observed between the distant Bering Sea and Washington Coast samples. Islands of differentiation were much smaller than the four large inversions among Atlantic cod ecotypes. Islands of differentiation between the Bering Sea and Aleutian Island were associated with SNPs from five vision system genes, which can be associated with feeding, predator avoidance, orientation, and socialization. We hypothesize that islands of differentiation between Pacific cod from the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands provide evidence for adaptive differentiation despite gene flow in this commercially important marine species.","[Spies, Ingrid; Hauser, Lorenz] Alaska Fisheries Sci Ctr, Resource Ecol & Fisheries Management Div, 7600 Sand Point Way NE, Seattle, WA 98115 USA; [Tarpey, Carolyn; Fisher, Mary] Univ Washington, Sch Aquat & Fishery Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Kristiansen, Trond] Farallon Inst Inc, Petaluma, CA USA; [Rohan, Sean] Alaska Fisheries Sci Ctr, Resource Assessment & Conservat Engn Div, Seattle, WA 98115 USA","National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA","Spies, I (corresponding author), Alaska Fisheries Sci Ctr, Resource Ecol & Fisheries Management Div, 7600 Sand Point Way NE, Seattle, WA 98115 USA.","ingrid.spies@noaa.gov","Kristiansen, Tore/ABC-7142-2020; Hauser, Lorenz/E-4365-2010","Hauser, Lorenz/0000-0002-9238-654X; Spies, Ingrid/0000-0002-5177-276X","Cooperative Institute for Climate, Ocean, & Ecosystem Studies (CICOES) under NOAA Cooperative Agreement [NA20OAR4320271]; Norton Sound Fund; NOAA National Marine Fisheries Service Saltonstall-Kennedy [16WCR034]","Cooperative Institute for Climate, Ocean, & Ecosystem Studies (CICOES) under NOAA Cooperative Agreement; Norton Sound Fund; NOAA National Marine Fisheries Service Saltonstall-Kennedy","Cooperative Institute for Climate, Ocean, & Ecosystem Studies (CICOES) under NOAA Cooperative Agreement, Grant/Award Number: NA20OAR4320271; NOAA National Marine Fisheries Service Saltonstall--Kennedy, Grant/Award Number: 16WCR034; Norton Sound Fund",NA,105,0,0,0,20,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","1752-4571","","","EVOL APPL","Evol.

Otoliths can provide a wealth of taxonomic and life history information about fish, which can help fill these knowledge gaps; however, there has been relatively little research to date on the otoliths of mesopelagic species. Here, a species-specific image library was assembled of sagittal otoliths from 70 mesopelagic fishes belonging to 29 families collected in the western North Atlantic Ocean. Images of adult sagittal otoliths from 12 species were documented and photographed for the first time. The fish were identified to species with a combination of morphological characters and DNA barcoding. Regressions between otolith size and fish length are presented for the six species with the largest sample sizes in this study. This otolith image library, coupled with otolith-length and width to fish-length relationships, can be used for prey identification and back-calculation of fish size, making it a valuable tool for studies relating to food webs in the important yet poorly understood mesopelagic zone. In addition, the 44 fish barcodes generated in this study highlight the benefit of using an integrative taxonomic approach to studies of this nature, as well as add to existing public databases that enable cryptic species and metabarcoding analyses of mesopelagic species.","[Quigley, Lucinda A.] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Quigley, Lucinda A.; Caiger, Paul E.; Govindarajan, Annette F.; McMonagle, Helena; Lavery, Andone C.; Sosik, Heidi M.; Llopiz, Joel K.] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Biol Dept, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; [Caiger, Paul E.] Univ Auckland, Inst Marine Sci, Auckland, New Zealand; [McMonagle, Helena] Univ Washington, Sch Aquat & Fishery Sci, Seattle, WA USA; [Jech, J.

In September 2021, we conducted a search effort for beaked whales off the coast of Oregon using a towed hydrophone array and a visual search team. Approximately 350 km off the Columbia River mouth, we detected the vocalizations of an unidentified mesoplodont whale; we stopped our vessel and waited in the area until two unidentified juvenile Mesoplodon surfaced and stayed near our vessel for almost 2 hr. During that time, we took numerous photographs and videos, made behavioral observations, and recorded their vocalizations. The DNA sequence from a biopsy sample identified them as M. carlhubbsi. In this paper, we discuss our biological observations, including color patterning and acquired markings, behavioral observations, and describe for the first time the acoustic characteristics of this species. We confirm that M. carlhubbsi is the source of a previously unidentified acoustic signal known as BW37V, and we update what is known about the at-sea distribution of this species based on previous recordings and observational records.","[Ballance, Lisa T.

Seeps also factor into the global budget of methane, a potent greenhouse gas. Because of these factors, methane seeps influence not only local ocean ecology, but also biogeochemical cycles on a greater scale. Methane seeps host specialized microbial communities that vary significantly based on geography, seep gross morphology, biogeochemistry, and a diversity of other ecological factors including cross-domain species interactions. In this study, we collected sediment cores from six seep and non-seep locations from Grays and Quinault Canyons (46-47 degrees N) off Washington State, USA, as well as one non-seep site off the coast of Oregon, USA (45 degrees N) to quantify the scale of seep influence on biodiversity within marine habitats. These samples were profiled using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Predicted gene functions were generated using the program PICRUSt2, and the community composition and predicted functions were compared among samples. The microbial communities at seeps varied by seep morphology and habitat, whereas the microbial communities at non-seep sites varied by water depth. Microbial community composition and predicted gene function clearly transitioned from on-seep to off-seep in samples collected from transects moving away from seeps, with a clear ecotone and high diversity where methane-fueled habitats transition into the non-seep deep sea. Our work demonstrates the microbial and metabolic sphere of influence that extends outwards from methane seep habitats.","[Cummings, Susie; Thurber, Andrew R.] Oregon State Univ, Coll Sci, Dept Microbiol, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Bellucci, Lila M.

While coral transcriptomics and microbiome communities have previously been characterized, similarities and differences in their responses to different pathogenic sources has not yet been assessed. In this study, we inoculated four genets of the Caribbean branching coral Acropora palmata with a known coral pathogen (Serratia marcescens) and white band disease. We then characterized the coral's transcriptomic and prokaryotic microbiomes' (prokaryiome) responses to the disease inoculations, as well as how these responses were affected by a short-term heat stress prior to disease inoculation. We found strong commonality in both the transcriptomic and prokaryiomes responses, regardless of disease inoculation. Differences, however, were observed between inoculated corals that either remained healthy or developed active disease signs. Transcriptomic co-expression analysis identified that corals inoculated with disease increased gene expression of immune, wound healing, and fatty acid metabolic processes. Co-abundance analysis of the prokaryiome identified sets of both healthy-and-disease-state bacteria, while co-expression analysis of the prokaryiomes' inferred metagenomic function revealed infected corals' prokaryiomes shifted from free-living to biofilm states, as well as increasing metabolic processes. The short-term heat stress did not increase disease susceptibility for any of the four genets with any of the disease inoculations, and there was only a weak effect captured in the coral hosts' transcriptomic and prokaryiomes response. Genet identity, however, was a major driver of the transcriptomic variance, primarily due to differences in baseline immune gene expression. Despite genotypic differences in baseline gene expression, we have identified a common response for components of the coral holobiont to different disease inoculations. This work has identified genes and prokaryiome members that can be focused on for future coral disease work, specifically, putative disease diagnostic tools.","[Young, Benjamin D.; Traylor-Knowles, Nikki] Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine Atmospher & Earth Sci, Dept Marine Biol & Ecol, Miami, FL 33146 USA; [Young, Benjamin D.; Rosales, Stephanie M.; Kolodziej, Graham L.] Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine Atmospher & Earth Sci, Cooperat Inst Marine & Atmospher Sci, Miami, FL 33146 USA; [Young, Benjamin D.; Rosales, Stephanie M.; Enochs, Ian C.; Kolodziej, Graham L.] NOAA, Atlantic Oceanog & Meteorol Lab, Miami, FL 33149 USA; [Formel, Nathan] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Biol Dept, Woods Hole, MA USA; [Moura, Amelia] Coral Restorat Fdn, Tavernier, FL USA; [D'Alonso, Gabrielle L.] Mote Marine Lab, Summerland Key, FL USA","University of Miami; University of Miami; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Atlantic Oceanographic & Meteorological Laboratory (AOML); Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution; Mote Marine Laboratory & Aquarium","Young, BD (corresponding author), Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine Atmospher & Earth Sci, Dept Marine Biol & Ecol, Miami, FL 33146 USA.;Young, BD (corresponding author), Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine Atmospher & Earth Sci, Cooperat Inst Marine & Atmospher Sci, Miami, FL 33146 USA.;Young, BD (corresponding author), NOAA, Atlantic Oceanog & Meteorol Lab, Miami, FL 33149 USA.","benjamin.d.young@noaa.gov","Traylor-Knowles, Nikki/D-4354-2012; Enochs, Ian/B-8051-2014","Formel, Nathan/0000-0003-4730-8195; Young, Benjamin/0000-0002-5195-9399","NOAA Coral Reef Conservation Program [31252]; NSF [1951826]; Protect our Reefs Grant 2018-23","NOAA Coral Reef Conservation Program(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Protect our Reefs Grant 2018-23","ICE, Grant number 31252, NOAA Coral Reef Conservation Program.

This study combined physiological assays with next-generation sequencing to assess the potential for recovery from and acclimation to OA in the eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) and identify molecular mechanisms associated with resilience. In a reciprocal transplant experiment, larvae transplanted from elevated pCO(2) (similar to 1400 ppm) to ambient pCO(2) (similar to 350 ppm) demonstrated significantly lower mortality and larger size post-transplant than oysters remaining under elevated pCO(2) and had similar mortality compared to those remaining in ambient conditions. The recovery after transplantation to ambient conditions demonstrates the ability for larvae to rebound and suggests phenotypic plasticity and acclimation. Transcriptomic analysis supported this hypothesis as genes were differentially regulated under OA stress. Transcriptomic profiles of transplanted and non-transplanted larvae terminating in the same final pCO(2) converged, further supporting the idea that acclimation underlies resilience. The functions of differentially expressed genes included cell differentiation, development, biomineralization, ion exchange, and immunity. Results suggest acclimation as a mode of resilience to OA. In addition, the identification of genes associated with resilience can serve as a valuable resource for the aquaculture industry, as these could enable marker-assisted selection of OA-resilient stocks.","[Barbosa, Michelle; Schwaner, Caroline; Espinosa, Emmanuelle Pales; Allam, Bassem] SUNY Stony Brook, Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Stony Brook, NY 11790 USA","State University of New York (SUNY) System; Stony Brook University","Allam, B (corresponding author), SUNY Stony Brook, Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Stony Brook, NY 11790 USA.","bassem.allam@stonybrook.edu","","Pales Espinosa, Emmanuelle/0000-0003-1779-6757; Allam, Bassem/0000-0003-1278-7915","NOAA's Northeast Sea Grant College Consortium; NOAA Ocean Acidification Program [R/XG-24]; National Science Foundation [IOS 1656753]; Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission [19-0802]","NOAA's Northeast Sea Grant College Consortium(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); NOAA Ocean Acidification Program(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission","This research was funded by a grant from NOAA's Northeast Sea Grant College Consortium in partnership with the NOAA Ocean Acidification Program to Bassem Allam and Emmanuelle Pales Espinosa (Project R/XG-24).

The results indicated there were two groups of trajectories: a nearshore group that tended to be retained and an offshore group that tended toward export and potential long-distance dispersal. We also found evidence of a relationship between retention and higher fish-egg abundance; nearshore stations were associated with higher fish-egg abundances and higher retention. We suggest this is the result of (1) increased spawning in high-retention areas, (2) increased drift convergence in high-retention areas, or both processes acting together.

In the past twenty years, omics techniques such as genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics have transformed that data landscape of many fields including the study of HABs. Advances in technology have facilitated the creation of many publicly available omics datasets that are complementary and shed new light on the mechanisms of HAB formation and toxin production. Genomics have been used to reveal differences in toxicity and nutritional requirements, while transcriptomics and proteomics have been used to explore HAB species responses to environmental stressors, and metabolomics can reveal mechanisms of allelopathy and toxicity. In this review, we explore how omics data may be leveraged to improve predictions of how climate change will impact HAB dynamics. We also highlight important gaps in our knowledge of HAS prediction, which include swimming behaviors, microbial interactions and evolution that can be addressed by future studies with omics tools. Lastly, we discuss approaches to incorporate current omics datasets into predictive numerical models that may enhance HAB prediction in a changing world. With the ever-increasing omics databases, leveraging these data for understanding climate-driven HAB dynamics will be increasingly powerful.","[Hennon, Gwenn M.

It is emphasized, however, that a scanning electron microscope is not necessary to observe even fine hinge structures associated with the early ontogenetic stages of the individual specimens depicted in these sequences. Such structures are readily visible using a wide range of optical compound microscopes equipped with high-intensity reflected light sources.

Multi-locus DNA sequence data is presented for seven of the nine species, and was combined with all publicly available data to produce the most comprehensive global phylogeny for the family to date.

We used multiplexed amplicon sequencing of 292 loci and genotyped clusters of single nucleotide polymoirphisms as microhaplotypes (N = 271 samples) in addition to mitochondrial (mtDNA) sequence data (N = 413 samples) to examine the genetic structure from samples collected along the Pacific coast and inland waterways from California to southern British Columbia. We confirmed an overall pattern of strong isolation-by-distance, suggesting that individual dispersal is restricted. We also found evidence of regions where genetic differences are larger than expected based on geographical distance alone, implying current or historical barriers to gene flow. In particular, the southernmost population in California is genetically distinct (F-ST = 0.02 [microhaplotypes]; 0.31 [mtDNA]), with both reduced genetic variability and high frequency of an otherwise rare mtDNA haplotype. At the northern end of our study range, we found significant genetic differentiation of samples from the Strait of Georgia, previously identified as a potential biogeographical boundary or secondary contact zone between harbor porpoise populations. Association of microhaplotypes with remotely sensed environmental variables indicated potential local adaptation, especially at the southern end of the species' range. These results inform conservation and management for this nearshore species, illustrate the value of genomic methods for detecting patterns of genetic structure within a continuously distributed marine species, and highlight the power of microhaplotype genotyping for detecting genetic structure in harbor porpoises despite reliance on poor-quality samples.","[Morin, Phillip A.; Hancock-Hanser, Brittany L.; Robertson, Kelly M.; Taylor, Barbara L.] NOAA, Southwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Forester, Brenna R.] Colorado State Univ, Dept Biol, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Forney, Karin A.] NOAA, Southwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Moss Landing, CA USA; [Forney, Karin A.] San Jose State Univ, Moss Landing Marine Labs, Moss Landing, CA USA; [Crossman, Carla A.] St Marys Univ, Biol Dept, Halifax, NS, Canada; [Crossman, Carla A.; Barrett-Lennard, Lance G.] Vancouver Aquarium, Cetacean Res Program, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Baird, Robin W.; Calambokidis, John] Cascadia Res Collect, Olympia, WA USA; [Gearin, Pat; Parsons, Kim M.] NOAA, Marine Mammal Lab, Alaska Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Seattle, WA USA; [Hanson, M.

These same observations can be priceless for researchers working with these species, so an interface between the scientific communities and recreational divers would be mutually beneficial. In this paper, we describe one such interface through the photography, collection, and DNA barcoding of larval fishes from the island of Hawaii. The images and videos from this activity provide an exciting window into the epipelagic environment and the way larval fishes appear and swim within it. Blackwater diving allows us to see the often-elaborate appendages and other specializations of these larvae as they appear in situ, prior to extensive net and fixation damage. However, blackwater diving remains an almost exclusively recreational pursuit, particularly popular among underwater photographers, who have little interest in (or object to) collecting specimens for scientists. Nonetheless, a logical next step is careful hand collection of specimens for scientific study. Growing numbers of recreational divers around the world have access to an otherwise expensive-to-research habitat. Here we present, for the first time, in situ and post-fixation photos of larval fishes that were hand collected and fixed in 95% ethanol by blackwater divers operating out of Kona, Hawaii, with DNA barcode identifications congruent with morphology and pigmentation where possible. With the right motivation, blackwater diving could augment research in the pelagic ocean and significantly enhance natural history collections and our knowledge of the larvae of marine fishes.","[Nonaka, Ai; Johnson, G.

While the stimulating effect of OA on bioerosion has been demonstrated experimentally, predominantly in the Pacific, the underlying physiological and molecular mechanisms behind the response are still poorly understood.MethodsTo address this, we subjected common zooxanthellate (Cliona varians) and azooxanthellate (Pione lampa) Caribbean sponges to pre-industrial (8.15 pH), present-day (8.05 pH), and two future OA scenarios (moderate OA, 7.85 pH; extreme OA, 7.75 pH) and evaluated their physiological and transcriptomic responses.ResultsThe influence of OA on sponge bioerosion was nonlinear for both species, with the greatest total bioerosion and chemical dissolution rates found in the 7.85 pH treatment, then not increasing further under the more extreme 7.75 pH conditions. A trend towards reduced bioerosion rates in the 7.75 pH treatment occurred regardless of the presence of algal symbionts and suggests that the sponges may become physiologically impaired under prolonged OA exposure, resulting in diminished bioerosion potential. These findings were supported by the RNA-seq analysis, which revealed differentially expressed genes involved in a stress response to OA, in particular, suppressed metabolism.DiscussionThis may indicate that the sponges had reallocated energy resources towards more critical physiological needs in response to OA as a survival mechanism under stressful conditions. These data reveal that while the bioerosion rates of excavating sponges in Caribbean reef ecosystems may increase under moderate OA scenarios, this OA-stimulation may plateau or be lost at extreme end-of-century pH conditions, with implications for the dissolution and long-term persistence of reef habitat structures.","[Morris, John T.; Enochs, Ian C.; Studivan, Michael S.; Young, Benjamin D.; Soderberg, Nash; Kolodziej, Graham] Natl Ocean & Atmospher Adm NOAA, Ocean Chem & Ecosyst Div, Atlantic Oceanog & Meteorol Lab, Miami, FL 33149 USA; [Morris, John T.; Studivan, Michael S.; Young, Benjamin D.; Soderberg, Nash; Kolodziej, Graham] Univ Miami, Cooperat Inst Marine & Atmospher Studies, Miami, FL 33149 USA; [Mayfield, Anderson] Coral Reef Diagnost, Miami, FL USA; [Traylor-Knowles, Nikki] Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine Atmospher & Earth Sci, Miami, FL USA; [Manzello, Derek] NOAA, Ctr Satellite Applicat & Res, Satellite Oceanog & Climatol Div, Coral Reef Watch, College Pk, MD USA","National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Atlantic Oceanographic & Meteorological Laboratory (AOML); University of Miami; University of Miami; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA","Morris, JT (corresponding author), Natl Ocean & Atmospher Adm NOAA, Ocean Chem & Ecosyst Div, Atlantic Oceanog & Meteorol Lab, Miami, FL 33149 USA.;Morris, JT (corresponding author), Univ Miami, Cooperat Inst Marine & Atmospher Studies, Miami, FL 33149 USA.","john.morris@noaa.gov","Kolodziej, Graham/A-3034-2017; Enochs, Ian/B-8051-2014","","NOAA Oceanic and Atmospheric Research's 'Omics Initiative; NOAA's Coral Reef Conservation Program","NOAA Oceanic and Atmospheric Research's 'Omics Initiative; NOAA's Coral Reef Conservation Program(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA)","Funding was provided by NOAA Oceanic and Atmospheric Research's 'Omics Initiative and NOAA's Coral Reef Conservation Program.

In mammals, lipids are suggested to be important for spermatogenesis and to structural components of the spermatozoa that could improve fertilization rates. New knowledge of how lipids affect sexual maturation in male Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), an important global aquaculture species, could provide tools to delay maturation and/or improve reproductive success. Therefore, changes in testicular composition of lipids and gene transcripts associated with spermatogenesis and lipid metabolism were studied in sexually maturing male salmon compared to immature males and females. An increase in total testis content of FA and PL, and a shift to higher PL composition was observed in maturing males, concomitant with increases in mRNA levels for genes involved in spermatogenesis, FA uptake and synthesis, and production of long chain-polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA) and PL. A particularly interesting finding was elevated testis expression of acyl-CoA synthetase 4 (acsl4), and acyl-CoA thioesterase 2 (acot2), critical enzymes that regulate intra-mitochondrial levels of 20:4n-6 FA (arachidonic acid), which have been associated with improved cholesterol transport during steroidogenesis. This suggested that FA may have direct effects on sex steroid production in salmon. Furthermore, we observed increased testis expression of genes for endogenous synthesis of 16:0 and elongation/desaturation to 22:6n-3 (docosahexaenoic acid) in sexually maturing males relative to immature fish. Both of these FA are important structural components of the PL, phosphatidylcholine (PC), and were elevated concomitant with increases in the content of phosphatidic acid, an important precursor for PC, in maturing males compared to immature fish. Overall, this study suggests that, similar to mammals, lipids are important to spermatogenesis and serve as structural components during testicular growth and maturation in Atlantic salmon.","[Bogevik, Andre S.] Nofima AS, Div Aquaculture, Fyllingsdalen, Norway; [Hayman, Edward S.] NOAA, Ocean Associates Inc, Contract Northwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Seattle, WA USA; [Bjerke, Malfrid T.; Dessen, Jens-Erik; Rorvik, Kjell-Arne] Nofima AS, Div Aquaculture, As, Norway; [Rorvik, Kjell-Arne] Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Dept Anim & Aquaculture Sci, As, Norway; [Luckenbach, J.

High-throughput sequencing of phylogenetically informative marker genes is a widely used method to assess the diversity and composition of microbial communities. Taxonomic assignment of sampled marker gene sequences (referred to as amplicon sequence variants, or ASVs) imparts ecological significance to these genetic data. To assign taxonomy to an ASV, a taxonomic assignment algorithm compares the ASV to a collection of reference sequences (a reference database) with known taxonomic affiliations. However, many taxonomic assignment algorithms and reference databases are available, and the optimal algorithm and database for a particular scientific question is often unclear. Here, we present the ensembleTax R package, which provides an efficient framework for integrating taxonomic assignments predicted with any number of taxonomic assignment algorithms and reference databases to determine ensemble taxonomic assignments for ASVs. Methods. The ensembleTax R package relies on two core algorithms: taxmapper and assign.ensembleTax. The taxmapper algorithm maps taxonomic assignments derived from one reference database onto the taxonomic nomenclature (a set of taxonomic naming and ranking conventions) of another reference database. The assign.ensembleTax algorithm computes ensemble taxonomic assignments for each ASV in a data set based on any number of taxonomic assignments determined with independent methods. Various parameters allow analysts to prioritize obtaining either more ASVs with more predicted clade names or more robust clade name predictions supported by multiple independent methods in ensemble taxonomic assignments. Results. The ensembleTax R package is used to compute two sets of ensemble taxonomic assignments for a collection of protistan ASVs sampled from the coastal ocean. Comparisons of taxonomic assignments predicted by individual methods with those predicted by ensemble methods show that conservative implementations of the ensembleTax package minimize disagreements between taxonomic assignments predicted by individual and ensemble methods, but result in ASVs with fewer ranks assigned taxonomy. Less conservative implementations of the ensembleTax package result in an increased fraction of ASVs classified at all taxonomic ranks, but increase the number of ASVs for which ensemble assignments disagree with those predicted by individual methods. Discussion. We discuss how implementation of the ensembleTax R package may be optimized to address specific scientific objectives based on the results of the application of the ensembleTax package to marine protist communities. While further work is required to evaluate the accuracy of ensemble taxonomic assignments relative to taxonomic assignments predicted by individual methods, we also discuss scenarios where ensemble methods are expected to improve the accuracy of taxonomy prediction for ASVs.","[Catlett, Dylan; Son, Kevin; Liang, Connie] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Earth Res Inst, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA","University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara","Catlett, D (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Earth Res Inst, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.","dsc@ucsb.edu","","","National Aeronautics and Space Administration Biodiversity and Ecological Forecasting program [NNX14AR62A]; Bureau of Ocean and Energy Management Ecosystem Studies program (BOEM) [MC15AC00006]; NOAA of the Santa Barbara Channel Biodiversity Observation Network; NASA Earth and Space Science Fellowship [NNX16AO44HS02]; UC Santa Barbara Coastal Fund [SPR19-18]","National Aeronautics and Space Administration Biodiversity and Ecological Forecasting program; Bureau of Ocean and Energy Management Ecosystem Studies program (BOEM); NOAA of the Santa Barbara Channel Biodiversity Observation Network(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); NASA Earth and Space Science Fellowship; UC Santa Barbara Coastal Fund","This work was supported by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Biodiversity and Ecological Forecasting program (Grant NNX14AR62A), the Bureau of Ocean and Energy Management Ecosystem Studies program (BOEM award MC15AC00006), and NOAA in support of the Santa Barbara Channel Biodiversity Observation Network.

Microcystis diversity and function in field samples and laboratory cultures can be determined by sequencing whole genomes of cultured isolates or natural populations, but these methods remain computationally and financially expensive. Amplicon sequencing of marker genes is a lower cost and higher throughput alternative to characterize strain composition and diversity in mixed samples. However, the selection of appropriate marker gene region(s) and primers requires prior understanding of the relationship between single gene genotype, whole genome content, and phenotype. To identify phylogenetic markers of Microcystis strain diversity, we compared phylogenetic trees built from each of 2,351 individual core genes to an established phylogeny and assessed the ability of these core genes to predict whole genome content and bioactive compound genotypes. We identified single-copy core genes better able to resolve Microcystis phylogenies than previously identified marker genes. We developed primers suitable for current Illumina-based amplicon sequencing with near-complete coverage of available Microcystis genomes and demonstrate that they outperform existing options for assessing Microcystis strain composition. Results showed that genetic markers can be used to infer Microcystis gene content and phenotypes such as potential production of bioactive compounds , although marker performance varies by bioactive compound gene and sequence similarity. Finally, we demonstrate that these markers can be used to characterize the Microcystis strain composition of laboratory or field samples like those collected for surveillance and modeling of Microcystis-dominated cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms.","[Kiledal, E.

Previous studies have documented other taxa in blooms capable of producing other cyanotoxins. Furthermore, benthic cyanobacteria have historically been overlooked in Lake Erie. Saxitoxin is a cyanotoxin of emerging concern in freshwater, and the sxtA gene which encodes its production has been found in the Maumee River and central basin of Lake Erie. Collectively, these points indicated that saxitoxin-producing cyanobacteria may also occur in the western basin. We utilized three sources of data to determine the spatial and temporal distribution of potential saxitoxin-producing cyanobacteria in the water column (years 2018-2022) and deployed nutrient diffusing substrata (NDS) to determine the impact of nutrients, depth, and season on potentialSTX producing benthic cyanobacteria (years 2018 & 2019). The water column datasets showed that hotspots of sxtA lasted only a few weeks. sxtA gene copies per mL did not correlate with Dolichospermum or Aphanizomenon biovolume, which have been associated with sxtA elsewhere. In the NDS, saxitoxin (ng/cm2) and cyanobacteria chlorophyll were inversely correlated with the highest saxitoxin in September and at the deeper depth, whereas cyanobacteria chlorophyll was highest during June and at the shallower depth. This research suggests continued monitoring is needed to determine drivers of saxitoxin in the western basin, and we recommend that future Lake Erie cyanobacteria research should not solely focus on microcystins and planktonic blooms.","[Nauman, Callie; Reitz, Laura A.] Bowling Green State Univ, Biol Sci, Bowling Green, OH USA; [Stanislawczyk, Keara; Chaffin, Justin D.] Ohio State Univ, FT Stone Lab, 878 Bayview Ave, Put In Bay, OH 43456 USA; [Reitz, Laura A.] Univ Michigan, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, 2534 North Univ Bldg,1100 North Univ Ave, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","University System of Ohio; Bowling Green State University; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan","Chaffin, JD (corresponding author), Ohio State Univ, FT Stone Lab, 878 Bayview Ave, Put In Bay, OH 43456 USA.","Chaffin.46@osu.edu","","Chaffin, Justin/0000-0002-5372-4577","NOAA NCCOS","NOAA NCCOS(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA)","This research was funded by United States federal sources and one state of Ohio source: the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science under award NA17NOS4780186 to the Ohio State University; the National Institutes of Health (NIH) (1P01ES028939-01) and National Science Foundation (OCE-1840715) awards to the Bowling Green State University Great Lakes Center for Fresh Waters and Human Health; and by the Harmful Algal Bloom Research Initiative grant from the Ohio Department of Higher Education.

This study characterized molecular and morphological sex differentiation in sablefish (Anoplopoma fimbria), a marine teleost with established XX/XY genotypic sex determination. Next generation sequencing was conducted on sablefish ovarian and testicular mRNAs to obtain sequences for transcripts associated with vertebrate sex determination and differentiation and early reproductive development. Gene-specific PCRs were developed to determine the distribution and ontogenetic gonadal expression of transcription, growth, steroidogenic and germline factors, as well as gonadotropin and steroid receptors. Molecular changes associated with sex differentiation were first apparent in both XY- and XX-genotype sablefish at similar to 60 mm in body length and prior to histological signs of sex differentiation. The earliest and most robust markers of testicular differentiation were gsdf, amh, dmrt1, cyp11b, star, sox9a, and fshr. Markedly elevated mRNA levels of several steroidogenesis-related genes and ar2 in differentiating testes suggested that androgens play a role in sablefish testicular differentiation. The earliest markers of ovarian differentiation were cyp19a1a, lhcgr, foxl2, nr0b1, and igf3. Other transcripts such as figla, zp3, and pou5f3 were expressed predominantly in XX-genotype fish and significantly increased with the first appearance and subsequent development of primary oocytes. This study provides valuable insight to the developmental sequence of events associated with gonadal sex differentiation in marine teleosts with XX/XY sex determination. It also implicates particular genes in processes of male and female development and establishes robust molecular markers for phenotypic sex in sablefish, useful for ongoing work related to sex control and reproductive sterilization.","[Hayman, Edward S.] NOAA, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Northwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Ocean Associates Inc, 2725 Montlake Blvd E, Seattle, WA 98112 USA; [Fairgrieve, William T.; Luckenbach, J.

The Cross Seamount beaked whale is known only from its unique echolocation signal (BWC) with no confirmed species identification. This beaked whale spans the Pacific Ocean from the Mariana Archipelago to Baja California, Mexico, south to the equator, but only as far north as latitude 29 & DEG;N. Within these warm waters, 92% of BWC detections occurred at night, 6% during crepuscular periods, and only 2% during daylight hours. Detections of BWC signals on drifting recorders with a vertical hydrophone array at 150 m depth demonstrated that foraging often occurred shallow in the water column (<150 m). No other species of beaked whale to date has been documented foraging in waters this shallow. Given their nocturnal, shallow foraging dives, this species appears to prefer prey that may be available in the water column only during those hours.

The TS of fish is influenced by the contrast in acoustic impedance between their tissues and the surrounding water. While the swimbladder is responsible for most of the backscatter in fish with gas-filled swim bladders, the backscatter in bladderless fish is a combination of that of fish tissues. The aim of this paper is to explain the marked differences in acoustic properties reported between skipjack tuna and Atlantic mackerel, two important pelagic fish species that lack a swimbladder. The study measures the acoustic properties (density and sound speed) of their flesh and backbone. These measurements are then used to simulate acoustic backscattering using a numerical model based on the Method of Fundamental Solutions, covering a range of frequencies and fish lengths relevant to fisheries acoustics. The numerical estimation of the TS shows that the differences in the material properties of the tissues predict the reported differences in the reduced target strength of more than 10 dB greater for skipjack than for mackerel at 38 kHz and 120 kHz. The study contributes to the understanding of the complex acoustic field backscattered by bladderless fish species and provides insights into the role of fish tissue material properties in the interpretation of acoustic response differences between species.","[Ladino, A.; Perez-Arjona, I.; Espinosa, V.; Chillaron, M.; Vidal, V.] Univ Politecn Valencia UPV, Cami Vera s-n, Valencia 46022, Spain; [Godinho, L.

Transcriptomic approaches based on RNA sequencing are useful tools for quantifying gene expression plasticity, particularly in slow-growing species such as scleractinian corals, and for identifying potential functional differences among conspecifics. A tag-based RNA-Seq (Tag-Seq) pipeline was applied to quantify transcriptional variation in natural populations of the scleractinian coralMontastraea cavernosafrom mesophotic and shallower environments across five sites in Belize and the Gulf of Mexico: Carrie Bow Cay, West and East Flower Garden Banks, Pulley Ridge, and Dry Tortugas. Regional site location was a stronger driver of gene expression patterns than depth. However, mesophotic corals among all sites shared similar regulation of metabolic and cell growth functional pathways that may represent common physiological responses to environmental conditions at depth. Additionally, in a transplant experiment at West and East Flower Garden Banks, colonies transplanted from mesophotic to shallower habitats diverged from the control mesophotic group over time, indicating depth-regulated plasticity of gene expression. When the shallower depth zone experienced a bleaching event, bleaching severity did not differ significantly between transplants and shallow controls, but gene expression patterns indicated variable regulation of stress responses among depth treatments. Coupled observational and experimental studies of gene expression among mesophotic and shallowerM. cavernosaprovide insights into the ability of this depth-generalist coral species to persist under varying environmental conditions.","[Studivan, Michael S.; Voss, Joshua D.] Florida Atlantic Univ, Oceanog Inst, Harbor Branch, Ft Pierce, FL 34946 USA; [Studivan, Michael S.] Univ Miami, Cooperat Inst Marine & Atmospher Studies, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Miami, FL 33149 USA","Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institute Foundation; State University System of Florida; Florida Atlantic University; University of Miami","Studivan, MS; Voss, JD (corresponding author), Florida Atlantic Univ, Oceanog Inst, Harbor Branch, Ft Pierce, FL 34946 USA.;Studivan, MS (corresponding author), Univ Miami, Cooperat Inst Marine & Atmospher Studies, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Miami, FL 33149 USA.","studivanms@gmail.com; jvoss2@fau.edu","","Voss, Joshua/0000-0002-0653-2767; Studivan, Michael/0000-0002-3771-0415","National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration [NA09OAR4320073, NA11NOS4780045, NA14OAR4320260]; Florida Atlantic University","National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); Florida Atlantic University","National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Grant/Award Number: NA09OAR4320073, NA11NOS4780045 and NA14OAR4320260; Florida Atlantic University",NA,95,7,9,4,25,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","0962-1083","1365-294X","","MOL ECOL","Mol.

However, it is still difficult to assess the diversity of lower taxa, especially at the species level. One tool for improving the identification of lower taxa are genetic markers that can distinguish cryptic species and assess species boundaries. Here, we present one such approach for an important and challenging group of reef-building corals. Porites corals are the main reef-builders of many coral reefs in the Indo-Pacific, owing to the massive growth forms of some species. The current number of valid Porites species is controversial, inflated with many synonymies, and often based on gross colony morphology although several morphospecies believed to be widespread and common can only be distinguished based on detailed microstructure analyses by taxonomic experts. Here, we test the suitability of multiple regions of mtDNA as genetic barcodes to identify suitable markers for species differentiation and unambiguous identification. Resulting sequencing data was further used for the first phylogenetic analysis of Guam's Porites species. We tested eight different mitochondrial markers and analyzed four in detail for 135 Porites specimens: mtDNA markers were amplified for 67 Porites specimens from Guam, representing 12 nominal Porites species, and combined with 69 mitochondrial genomes, mostly from Hawaii. The combination of all 4 markers distinguished 10 common and 7 uncommon Central-West Pacific Porites species. Most clades separate species along taxonomic boundaries, which is uncommon for Porites corals and testifies to the suitability of our multi-marker approach, and a combination of the two most promising barcodes distinguished 8/10 common species. These barcodes are thus suitable to distinguish virtually cryptic species in one of the most important and challenging coral genera. They offer a cheap, fast and reliable way to identify Porites species for species-level research, monitoring and conservation.","[Combosch, David J.; Burdick, David; Primov, Karim; Rios, Dareon; Rios, Kireon; Fernandez, Jessica] Univ Guam, Marine Lab, Mangilao, GU 96923 USA","University of Guam","Combosch, DJ (corresponding author), Univ Guam, Marine Lab, Mangilao, GU 96923 USA.","dcombosch@gmail.com","","Burdick, David/0000-0002-1716-4437; Combosch, David/0000-0001-7004-7435","NSF; NOAA; National Park Service [P21AC12027]; Guam NSF EPSCoR through the National Science Foundation [OIA-1457769, OIA-1946352]; Coral Reef Conservation Grant [P16AC01681]","NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NOAA(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); National Park Service; Guam NSF EPSCoR through the National Science Foundation; Coral Reef Conservation Grant","Funding for this research was provided by grants from NSF, NOAA and the National Park Service.

A total of 1034 PL belonging to 12 families, 22 genera, 24 species, 5 morphotypes and a species complex were identified. Abralia redfieldi, Onychoteuthis banksii and Ornithoteuthis antillarum were the most abundant taxa. The taxonomic identification from these three species was corroborated with DNA barcoding (99.8-100% of similarity). Paralarvae of Octopus insularis were reported for the first time in the wild. Most PL occupied the Caribbean Surface Water mass in the 0-25 m depth stratum. Largest paralarval abundances were related to local oceanographic features favouring retention such as the Honduras Gyre and Cozumel eddy. No day-night differences were found in PL abundance, although Abralia redfieldi showed evidence of diel vertical migration. Distribution of PL in epipelagic waters of the MBRS was probably related to ontogenetic migration, hydrographic features of meso and subscale, and to the circulation regimes dominated by the Yucatan Current. The MBRS represents an important dispersion area for PL, potentially connecting a species-rich Caribbean community with the Gulf of Mexico and Florida waters.","[Castillo-Estrada, Gabriela; Markaida, Unai] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Posgrad Ciencias Mar & Limnol, Ciudad Univ 3000, Coyoacan 04510, Mexico; [Castillo-Estrada, Gabriela; Aviles-Diaz, Laura; Markaida, Unai] Colegio Frontera Sur CONACyT, Lab Pesquerias Artesanales, Ave Rancho Poligono 2A, Lerma 24500, Campeche, Mexico; [De Silva-Davila, Roxana] Inst Politecn Nacl, Dept Plancton & Ecol Marina, Ctr Interdisciplinario Ciencias Marinas, Ave IPN S-N, La Paz 23096, Baja California, Mexico; [Carrillo, Laura; Vasquez-Yeomans, Lourdes] Colegio Frontera CONACyT, Dept Sistemat & Ecol Acuat, Ave Centenario,Km 5-5, Chetmal, Quintana Roo, Mexico; [Silva-Segundo, Claudia A.] Univ Autonoma Baja California Sur, Dept Ingn Pesquerias, Sur Km 5-5, La Paz 23080, Bcs, Mexico","Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico; Instituto Politecnico Nacional - Mexico; Universidad Autonoma de Baja California","Markaida, U (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Posgrad Ciencias Mar & Limnol, Ciudad Univ 3000, Coyoacan 04510, Mexico.;Markaida, U (corresponding author), Colegio Frontera Sur CONACyT, Lab Pesquerias Artesanales, Ave Rancho Poligono 2A, Lerma 24500, Campeche, Mexico.","umarkaida@ecosur.mx","Carrillo, Laura/AAC-5556-2022; De Silva-Dvila, Roxana/AAQ-7133-2021; Markaida, Unai/B-1288-2013","Vasquez-Yeomans, Lourdes/0000-0003-2095-1404; Markaida, Unai/0000-0001-6655-4979; Silva-Segundo, Claudia Alicia/0000-0002-5938-0576; De Silva-Davila, Roxana/0000-0002-1163-1217; Carrillo, Laura/0000-0001-8296-007X","NOAA's Coral Reef Conservation Program [1244]; research project `Coleccion biologica de referencia de paralarvas de cefalopodos' [SIP20161524]; CONACYT [251085]; Academy of Finland (AKA) [251085] Funding Source: Academy of Finland (AKA)","NOAA's Coral Reef Conservation Program(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); research project `Coleccion biologica de referencia de paralarvas de cefalopodos'; CONACYT(Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT)); Academy of Finland (AKA)(Research Council of Finland)","This work was partially funded by NOAA's Coral Reef Conservation Program #1244 led by J.

It has been unclear whether there has been cryptic speciation or morphological plasticity leading to different ecotypes of Rhodactis howesii. Here, we use mitochondrial genomic analysis to assess species validation and underlying cause of morphological variation across the atoll. We mapped sequenced reads to Rhodactis indosinensis, R. howesii's closest recorded genomic taxon. In addition to one individual from American Samoa, we assessed phylogenetic relationships of published corallimorph genomes with those from Palmyra. There was no identifiable population structure within Palmyra, and available dinoflagellate symbiont communities were consistent among the sequenced individuals. There were noticeable differences in symbiont communities between Palmyra and American Samoa individuals, as well as six fixed nucleotide differences. We conclude that the lack of taxonomically validated genetic reference material together with vague species descriptions, morphological plasticity and overlap among morphological characters, combine to raise doubts about the validity of the currently accepted species name, R. howesii. Comparison of our results to all currently available genetic data for corallimorpharians suggests that the species at Palmyra is most closely related to an unidentified species of Rhodactis from Okinawa. However, taxonomically confirmed R. howesii is absent from genetic databases, so no firm conclusions about species identification can yet be drawn. It seems clear that this group is in need of additional taxonomic work and a broad phylogenetic survey of taxa with geographic distribution would further our understanding of marine biodiversity, conservation, and invasion dynamics of this understudied group.","[Jacobs, Kaitlyn P.; Forsman, Zac H.; de Souza, Mariana Rocha; Toonen, Robert J.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Inst Marine Biol, Kaneohe, HI 96744 USA; [Jacobs, Kaitlyn P.; Hunter, Cynthia L.; de Souza, Mariana Rocha] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Marine Biol Grad Program, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Pollock, Amanda L.] US Fish & Wildlife Serv, Honolulu, HI USA","University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; United States Department of the Interior; US Fish & Wildlife Service","Jacobs, KP (corresponding author), Univ Hawaii Manoa, Inst Marine Biol, Kaneohe, HI 96744 USA.;Jacobs, KP (corresponding author), Univ Hawaii Manoa, Marine Biol Grad Program, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.","kjacobs8@hawaii.edu","Forsman, Zac/F-1266-2015; Toonen, Rob/V-6230-2019; de Souza, Mariana/L-5004-2017","","University of Hawai'i at Manoa School of Life Science's Edmondson Fund; Hawai'i Institiute of Marine Biology's Lord Scholarship; NSF-OA [1416889]; NOAA [NA19NOS4780196]","University of Hawai'i at Manoa School of Life Science's Edmondson Fund; Hawai'i Institiute of Marine Biology's Lord Scholarship; NSF-OA; NOAA(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA)","We thank the HIMB EPSCoR core facility and the University of Hawai'i's Advanced Studies in Genomics, Proteomics, and Bioinformatics facility for their assistance with DNA sequencing.

A quantitative polymerase chain reaction-based method was developed and tested for estimating the species-specific biomass of juvenile copepods through targeted measurements of mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (mtCOI) gene copies in size-fractionated, mixed-species plankton samples. The assays are species-specific, amplifying a single product in the presence of focal-species DNA at levels as low as 2 pg total DNA, and in mixed-species samples where the focal species represented <1% of total DNA. Tests comparing mtCOI copy number to measurements of biomass across developmental stages found a robust linear relationship across a five order of magnitude range in animal biomass and DNA copy number (r(2) = 0.998). These results demonstrate that quantification of DNA copy number can be used to obtain estimates of species-specific biomass for metazoan plankton, which could transform population and community dynamics studies that include early life history stages.","[Jungbluth, Michelle J.; Hanson, Katharine M.; Goetze, Erica] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Sch Ocean & Earth Sci & Technol, Dept Oceanog, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Jungbluth, Michelle J.] San Francisco State Univ, Estuary & Ocean Sci Ctr, Tiburon, CA 94920 USA; [Hanson, Katharine M.] Duke Univ, Biol Dept, Durham, NC USA; [Lenz, Petra H.; Robinson, H.

Because both repurpose the same set of enzymes but differ in their spatial and temporal deployment, they have long been considered as distinct and incompatible adaptations. Portulaca contains multiple C-4 species that perform CAM when droughted. Spatially explicit analyses of gene expression reveal that C-4 and CAM systems are completely integrated in Portulaca oleracea, with CAM and C-4 carbon fixation occurring in the same cells and CAM-generated metabolites likely incorporated directly into the C-4 cycle. Flux balance analysis corroborates the gene expression findings and predicts an integrated C-4+CAM system under drought.

Novel ideas and underutilised resources that may assist both analytic assessments and spatially oriented modelling include (1) species and environmental databases; (2) mining of data from scattered sources; (3) infilling of data gaps by spatial analysis; (4) age estimation from measurements of DNA methylation; evaluation of eel abundance by (5) larval, (6) glass-bottom boat, (7) net enclosure and (8) eDNA surveys; (9) accounting for dam-induced habitat increases in eel watercourse modelling; (10) spatially oriented modelling with and without temporal components; (11) geographically nested modelling of glass eel recruitment; (12) spawner per recruit modelling and (13) life cycle modelling to examine larval allocation effects. Eel biologists are too few to gather the required assessment data across all of the species' range. Public posting of electrofishing and eDNA metabarcoding data sets and the use of machine learning techniques to comprehensively inventory small dams will help meet some data needs. These approaches address only a small proportion of the assessment challenges that face American eels. Worldwide collaboration amongst Anguilla scientists is a key enabler of progress towards stock assessment goals.","[Cairns, David K.] Fisheries & Oceans Canada, POB 1236, Charlottetown, PE C1A 7M8, Canada; [Benchetrit, Jose] Fisheries & Oceans Canada, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Bernatchez, Louis] Univ Laval, Dept Biol, Quebec City, PQ, Canada; [Bornarel, Virginie] Univ British Columbia, Zool Dept, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Casselman, John M.] Queens Univ, Biol Dept, Kingston, ON, Canada; [Castonguay, Martin] Fisheries & Oceans Canada, Mont Joli, PQ, Canada; [Charsley, Anthony R.] Natl Inst Water & Atmospher Res, Wellington, New Zealand; [Dorow, Malte; Frankowski, Jens] State Res Ctr Agr & Fisheries Mecklenburg Vorpomm, Inst Fisheries, Rostock, Germany; [Drouineau, Hilaire] HYNES INRAE EDF R&D, Unite EABX Ecosyst Aquat & Changements Globaux, INRAE, Cestas, France; [Drouineau, Hilaire] INRAE, Agrocampus Ouest, Management Diadromous Fish Environm OFB, UPPA, Rennes, France; [Haro, Alex] US Geol Survey, SO Conte Anadromous Fish Res Branch, Eastern Ecol Sci Ctr, Turners Falls, MA USA; [Hoyle, Simon D.] Natl Inst Water & Atmospher Res, Port Nelson, New Zealand; [Knickle, D.

P. bahamense is a toxic, bioluminescent dinoflagellate that previously bloomed in Florida with no known record of saxitoxin (STX) production. Over the past 20 years, STX was identified in P. bahamense populations. The goal of this study was to examine toxin dynamics and associated molecular mechanisms in spatially and temporally distinct P. bahamense populations from the Indian River Lagoon, FL. SxtA4 is a key gene required for toxin biosynthesis. SxtA4 genotype analysis was performed on individual cells from multiple sites. Cell abundance, toxin quota cell(-1), and sxtA4 and RubisCo (rbcL) transcript abundance were also measured. There was a significant negative correlation between cell abundance and toxin quota cell(-1). While the sxtA4+ genotype was dominant at all sites, its frequency varied, but it occurred at 90-100% in many samples. The underlying mechanism for toxin decrease with increased cell abundance remains unknown. However, a strong, statistically significant negative correlation was found between stxA4 transcripts and the sxtA4/rbcL ratio, suggesting cells make fewer sxtA4 transcripts as a bloom progresses. However, the influence of sxtA4- cells must also be considered. Future plans include bioluminescence measurements, normalized to a per cell basis, at sites when toxicity is measured along with concomitant quantification of sxtA4 gene and transcript copy numbers as a means to elucidate whether changes in bloom toxicity are driven more at the genetic (emergence of sxtA4- cells) or transcriptional (repression of sxtA4 in sxtA4+ cells) level. Based on the results of this study, a model is proposed that links the combined traits of toxicity and bioluminescence in P. bahamense bloom development.","[Cusick, Kathleen D.; Brown, Nicole] Univ Maryland Baltimore Cty, Dept Biol Sci, Baltimore, MD 21250 USA; [Wei, Bofan; Hall, Sydney; Boyer, Gregory L.] SUNY Syracuse, Coll Environm Sci & Forestry, Dept Chem, Syracuse, NY 13210 USA; [Widder, Edith A.] Ocean Res & Conservat Assoc, Vero Beach, FL 32960 USA","University System of Maryland; University of Maryland Baltimore County; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) College of Environmental Science & Forestry","Cusick, KD (corresponding author), Univ Maryland Baltimore Cty, Dept Biol Sci, Baltimore, MD 21250 USA.","kcusick@umbc.edu; bwei101@esf.edu; shall8@esf.edu; nbrown14@umbc.edu; ewidder@teamorca.org; glboyer@esf.edu","Cusick, Kathleen/AAZ-4174-2020","Cusick, Kathleen/0000-0001-7224-3472","NOAA Center for Sponsored Coastal Ocean Research Coastal Ocean Program [NA20NOS4780186]","NOAA Center for Sponsored Coastal Ocean Research Coastal Ocean Program(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA)","Toxin analysis was supported by NOAA Center for Sponsored Coastal Ocean Research Coastal Ocean Program's NA20NOS4780186 via a subaward to SUNY-ESF.",NA,58,0,0,2,2,"MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","","1660-3397","","MAR DRUGS","Mar.

They also provide significant ecosystem services, by supporting secondary production and fisheries. Phytoplankton biomass and diversity have been identified by the Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS) as Essential Ocean Variables (EOVs), properties that need to be monitored to better understand and predict the ocean system. Phytoplankton identification and enumeration relies on the skills and expertise of highly trained taxonomic analysts. The training of new taxonomic analysts is intensive and requires months to years of supervised training before an analyst is able to independently and consistently apply identification skills to a sample. During the COVID-19 pandemic, access to laboratories was greatly restricted and social distancing requirements prevented supervised training. However, access to phytoplankton imaging technologies such as the Imaging FlowCytobot (IFCB), FlowCam, and PlanktoScope, combined with open online taxonomic identification platforms such as EcoTaxa, provided a means to continue monitoring, research, and training activities remotely when in-person activities were restricted. Although such technologies can not entirely replace microscopy, they have a great potential for supporting an expansion in taxonomic training, monitoring, surveillance, and research capacity. In this paper we highlight a set of imaging and collaboration tools and describe how they were leveraged during laboratory lockdowns to advance research and monitoring goals. Anecdotally, we found that the use of imaging tools accelerated the training of new taxonomic analysts in our phytoplankton analysis laboratory. Based on these experiences, we outline how these technologies can be used to increase capacity in taxonomic training and expertise, as well as how they can be used more broadly to expand research opportunities and capacity.","","","","sclayton@odu.edu","Mulholland, Margaret/E-8480-2011","Mulholland, Margaret/0000-0001-8819-189X; Clayton, Sophie/0000-0001-7473-4873","Program for Undergraduate Research and Scholarship (PURS) grant from the Office of Research and Perry Honors College at Old Dominion University, Norfolk, VA, United States; Old Dominion University 4VA program; Hampton Roads Sanitation District; Virginia Department of Environmental Quality; Virginia Department of Health; NOAA EcoHAB [NA18NOS4780176]","Program for Undergraduate Research and Scholarship (PURS) grant from the Office of Research and Perry Honors College at Old Dominion University, Norfolk, VA, United States; Old Dominion University 4VA program; Hampton Roads Sanitation District; Virginia Department of Environmental Quality; Virginia Department of Health; NOAA EcoHAB(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA)","This work was supported by a Program for Undergraduate Research and Scholarship (PURS) grant from the Office of Research and Perry Honors College at Old Dominion University, Norfolk, VA, United States (SC).

Discovered by fishermen in the early 1900s, the FGBs are named after the colourful corals, sponges and algae that dominate the region. The reefs and banks are the surface expression of underlying salt domes and provide important habitat for mesophotic coral ecosystems (MCE) and deep coral communities to 300 m depth. Since 2001, FGBNMS research teams have utilized remotely operated vehicles (e.g. 'Phantom S2', 'Mohawk', 'Yogi') to survey and characterize benthic habitats of this region. In 2016, a Draft Environmental Impact Statement proposed the expansion of the current sanctuary boundaries to incorporate an additional 15 reefs and banks, including Elvers Bank. Antipatharians (black corals) were collected within the proposed expansion sites and analysed using morphological and molecular methods. A new species,Distichopathes hickersonae, collected at 172 m depth on Elvers Bank, is described within the family Aphanipathidae. This brings the total number of black coral species in and around the sanctuary to 14.","[Opresko, Dennis M.; Brugler, Mercer R.] Smithsonian Inst, Dept Invertebrate Zool, US Natl Museum Nat Hist, Washington, DC 20560 USA; [Goldman, Samantha L.] Cornell Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ithaca, NY USA; [Johnson, Raven; Parra, Katherine; Brugler, Mercer R.] CUNY, Dept Biol Sci, NYC Coll Technol, Brooklyn, NY 11210 USA; [Nuttall, Marissa; Schmahl, G.

From the NGS data, the full genome (1,849 bp) of a novel beaked whale circovirus (BWCV) was determined. Two open reading frames (ORF) were annotated, including ORF1 that encodes the capsid gene, ORF2 that encodes the replication-associated gene, and a 9-bp conserved nonamer on the apex of the open loop found in all circoviruses. Independent phylogenetic analyses based on amino acid sequence alignments of the two CV proteins supported the BWCV as a member of the genus Circovirus, branching as the sister species to the recently discovered canine circovirus. A sequence identity matrix generated from complete genome alignments revealed the BWCV displays between from 51.1 to 56.7% nucleotide identity to other circoviruses, which is lower than the 80% threshold proposed for species demarcation. Considering the genetic and phylogenetic analyses, we propose the formal species designation of beaked whale circovirus. An endpoint PCR assay targeting the BWCV genome confirmed the presence of the BWCV DNA in every tissue from which DNA was extracted, including spleen, muscle, left ventricle, left adrenal gland, liver, lung, cerebrum, cerebellum, and lymph node. An automated in situ hybridization assay utilizing RNAscope technology and targeting the replication-associated gene resulted in labeling of individual cells morphologically resembling mononuclear leukocytes and cells of blood vessels in diaphragm, liver, lymph nodes, lung, pericardium, oral mucosa and tongue, adrenal gland, testis, aorta, intestine, stomach and heart. The clinical or pathologic significance of BWCV is undetermined, as are its host range, prevalence, and pathogenicity in cetaceans of Hawaiian waters and elsewhere.","[Landrau-Giovannetti, Nelmarie; Subramaniam, Kuttichantran; Waltzek, Thomas B.] Univ Florida, Coll Vet Med, Dept Infect Dis & Immunol, 2187 Mowry Rd, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Brown, Melissa Ann] Univ Florida, Coll Vet Med, Mol Histotechnol Lab, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Ng, Terry Fei Fan] Univ Georgia, Coll Vet Med, Athens, GA USA; [Rotstein, David S.] Marine Mammal Pathol Serv, Olney, MD USA; [West, Kristi] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Hawaii Inst Marine Biol, POB 1346, Kaneohe, HI USA; [West, Kristi] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Human Nutr Food & Anim Sci, Coll Trop Agr & Human Resources, 1955 East West Rd,Ag Sci 216, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Frasca, Salvatore, Jr.] Univ Florida, Coll Vet Med, Dept Comparat Diagnost & Populat Med, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA","State University System of Florida; University of Florida; State University System of Florida; University of Florida; University System of Georgia; University of Georgia; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; State University System of Florida; University of Florida","Waltzek, TB (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Coll Vet Med, Dept Infect Dis & Immunol, 2187 Mowry Rd, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.","tbwaltzek@ufl.edu","Ng, Terry/H-5305-2019; Waltzek, Thomas/AHD-3209-2022; rotstein, david/K-6691-2019; Subramaniam, Kuttichantran/HJP-5895-2023","rotstein, david/0000-0001-7438-2281; Brown, Melissa A./0000-0001-5584-7637; Landrau-Giovannetti, Nelmarie/0000-0002-5732-5370; Ng, Terry Fei Fan/0000-0002-4815-8697; Subramaniam, Kuttichantran/0000-0002-2752-4467","NOAA John H.

The identification of fish larvae to species is a necessary step in using early life history data toward this goal. Three species of hakes from the genus Urophycis are common on the northeast United States continental shelf: U. chuss or Red Hake, U. regia or Spotted Hake, and U. tenuis or White Hake. Unfortunately, identification of larval Urophycis has long been only possible at the genus level. Larvae of Urophycis (n = 277) collected in a subset of ethanol-preserved samples were identified genetically through sequencing of the cytochrome oxidase I gene and were used to update morphological descriptions with characters that separate these three species at the larval stage. Sequencing occurred in two stages: the first (n = 88) to develop a set of known-identity larvae to define species-specific traits, the second (n = 189) to test morphological identification based on the traits described in this study. We describe a combination of the location of dorsal and ventral pigment, head pigment, lower jaw pigment, and the timing of development of the pectoral fins to distinguish the larvae of these three species at sizes 6 mm. Using molecular techniques to improve morphological identifications is a powerful and efficient way to obtain the species-level data needed for assessments and management.","[Marancik, Katrin E.] Integrated Stat, 28 Tarzwell Dr, Narragansett, RI 02882 USA; [Richardson, David E.] NOAA, Fisheries Northeast Fisheries Sci Ctr, 28 Tarzwell Dr, Narragansett, RI 02882 USA; [Konieczna, Malgorzata] Plankton Sorting & Identificat Ctr ZSIOP, Morski Inst Rybacki, Szczecin, Poland","National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; National Marine Fisheries Research Institute","Marancik, KE (corresponding author), Integrated Stat, 28 Tarzwell Dr, Narragansett, RI 02882 USA.","Katey.Marancik@noaa.gov; David.Richardson@noaa.gov","Richardson, David/A-3331-2008","","FY2015 NOAA Improve a Stock Assessment grant","FY2015 NOAA Improve a Stock Assessment grant(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA)","A great amount of help was provided by Rebecca Konijnenberg, HarveyWalsh, Jon Hare, the crews and scientists aboard NOAA ships involved in Ecosystem Monitoring Program cruises, the staff at the Canadian Centre for DNA Barcoding, and the staff at the Polish Sorting and Identification Center.

However, cyanoHAB research and monitoring programs face operational constraints due to the reliance on human resources for sample collections. To address this impediment, a third-generation Environmental Sample Processor (3G ESP) integrated with a long-range autonomous underwater vehicle (LRAUV) was tested during seasonal blooms of Microcystis in western Lake Erie (WLE) in 2018 and 2019. The LRAUV-3G ESP successfully performed flexible, autonomous sampling across a wide range of cyanoHAB conditions, and results indicated equivalency between autonomous and manual methods. No significant differences were found between LRAUV-3G ESP and manual sample collection and handling methods in the 12 parameters tested. Analyzed parameters included concentrations of total cyanobacteria and microcystin toxin gene via qPCR; relative abundances of bacterial amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) from 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing; and community diversity measures from both 16S amplicon and metagenomic sequencing. The LRAUV-3G ESP provided additional sampling capacity and revealed differences between field seasons for bacterial taxa and concentrations of total cyanobacteria and microcystin toxin gene. Metagenomic analysis of multiple microcystin toxin genes corroborated the use of the mcyE gene as a proxy for the genomic potential of WLE cyanoHABs to produce microcystin. Overall, this study provides support for the use of autonomous 'omics capability in WLE to help expand the spatial and temporal coverage of cyanoHAB monitoring operations.","[Uyl, Paul A.

Consequently, the objectives of this work were to 1) isolate marine bacteria from oysters and evaluate their protective activity against Vibrio coralliilyticus infection of Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) larvae, and 2) to determine the long-term effects of probiotic additions on growth and metamorphosis of larval Pacific and Kumamoto oysters (C. sikamea). A combination of three probiotic strains applied once 24 h post-fertilization was more effective in improving survival of larval C. gigas exposed to lethal concentrations of V. coralliilyticus strain RE22, compared with separate additions of individual probiotics. In addition, a single application of the probiotic combination to one-day-old larvae increased the larval metamorphosis success of C. sikamea and both the Midori and Myiagi stocks of C. gigas. These results suggest that probiotics are effective at preventing bacterial infections and can significantly improve performance of oyster larvae, using a single application early in their development.","[Madison, David; Langdon, Chris] Oregon State Univ, Coll Agr Sci, Coastal Oregon Marine Expt Stn, Corvallis, OR 97330 USA; [Madison, David; Langdon, Chris] Oregon State Univ, Coll Agr Sci, Dept Fisheries Wildlife & Conservat Sci, Corvallis, OR 97330 USA; [Schubiger, Carla; Lunda, Spencer] Oregon State Univ, Carlson Coll Vet Med, Dept Biomed Sci, Corvallis, OR 97330 USA; [Mueller, Ryan S.] Oregon State Univ, Coll Sci, Dept Microbiol, Corvallis, OR 97330 USA; [Madison, David] JL Trans Balauring, Kab Lembata 86681, Ntt, Indonesia","Oregon State University; Oregon State University; Oregon State University; Oregon State University","Schubiger, C (corresponding author), Oregon State Univ, Carlson Coll Vet Med, Dept Biomed Sci, Corvallis, OR 97330 USA.","carla.schubiger@oregonstate.edu","","Schubiger, Carla/0000-0002-6433-3125; Lunda, Spencer/0000-0001-5844-5342","NOAA National Sea Grant award [NA18OAR4170346]; NOAA Saltonstall-Kennedy grant [NA18NMF4270220]","NOAA National Sea Grant award(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); NOAA Saltonstall-Kennedy grant(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA)","The authors thank the MBP staff for their support in rearing larvae, Jennifer Hesser for assisting in some of the experiments, MK English for the 16S rRNA gene sequencing of the probiotic candidates.

Southern Resident killer whales (SRKW) (Orcinus orca) are an endangered population occurring primarily along the outer coast and inland waters of Washington and British Columbia. Insufficient prey has been identified as a factor limiting their recovery, so a clear understanding of their seasonal diet is a high conservation priority. Previous studies have shown that their summer diet in inland waters consists primarily of Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), despite that species' rarity compared to some other salmonids. During other times of the year, when occurrence patterns include other portions of their range, their diet remains largely unknown. To address this data gap, we collected feces and prey remains from October to May 2004-2017 in both the Salish Sea and outer coast waters. Using visual and genetic species identification for prey remains and genetic approaches for fecal samples, we characterized the diet of the SRKWs in fall, winter, and spring. Chinook salmon were identified as an important prey item year-round, averaging similar to 50% of their diet in the fall, increasing to 70-80% in the mid-winter/early spring, and increasing to nearly 100% in the spring. Other salmon species and non-salmonid fishes, also made substantial dietary contributions. The relatively high species diversity in winter suggested a possible lack of Chinook salmon, probably due to seasonally lower densities, based on SRKW's proclivity to selectively consume this species in other seasons. A wide diversity of Chinook salmon stocks were consumed, many of which are also at risk. Although outer coast Chinook samples included 14 stocks, four rivers systems accounted for over 90% of samples, predominantly the Columbia River. Increasing the abundance of Chinook salmon stocks that inhabit the whales' winter range may be an effective conservation strategy for this population.","[Hanson, M.

Philopatry displayed by many coastal shark species can impact gene flow and facilitate selection, and has direct implications for the spatial scales of management. Here, genetic structure of the blacktip shark (Carcharhinus limbatus) was examined using a mixed-marker approach employing mitochondrial control region sequences and 4339 SNP-containing loci generated using ddRAD-Seq. Genetic variation was assessed among young-of-the-year sampled in 11 sites in waters of the United States in the western North Atlantic Ocean, including the Gulf of Mexico. Spatial and environmental analyses detected 68 nuclear loci putatively under selection, enabling separate assessments of neutral and adaptive genetic structure. Both mitochondrial and neutral SNP data indicated three genetically distinct units-the Atlantic, eastern Gulf, and western Gulf-that align with regional stocks and suggest regional philopatry by males and females. Heterogeneity at loci putatively under selection, associated with temperature and salinity, was observed among sites within Gulf units, suggesting local adaptation. Furthermore, five pairs of siblings were identified in the same site across timescales corresponding with female reproductive cycles. This indicates that females re-used a site for parturition, which has the potential to facilitate the sorting of adaptive variation among neighbouring sites. The results demonstrate differential impacts of microevolutionary forces at varying spatial scales and highlight the importance of conserving essential habitats to maintain sources of adaptive variation that may buffer species against environmental change.","[Swift, Dominic G.

We characterized the gut microbiomes of stranded dwarf (Kogia sima) and pygmy (K. breviceps) sperm whales to examine the effects of phylogeny and life stage on microbiome composition and diversity. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis revealed diverse gut communities (averaging 674 OTUs) dominated by a few symbiont taxa (25 OTUs accounted for 64% of total relative abundance). Both phylogeny and life stage shaped community composition and diversity, with species-specific microbiome differences present early in life. Further analysis showed evidence of microbiome convergence with host maturity, albeit through different processes: symbiont 'accumulation' in K. sima and 'winnowing' in K. breviceps, indicating different methods of community assembly during host development. Furthermore, culture-based analyses yielded 116 pure cultures matching 25 OTUs, including one isolate positive for chitin utilization. Our findings indicate that kogiid gut microbiomes are highly diverse and species-specific, undergo significant shifts with host development, and can be cultivated on specialized media under anaerobic conditions. These results enhance our understanding of the kogiid gut microbiome and may provide useful information for symbiont assessment in host health.","[Denison, Elizabeth R.; Rhodes, Ryan G.; McLellan, William A.; Pabst, D.

To better understand coral responses to sublethal stressors in nearshore environments, we conducted complementary experiments to assess the impacts of estuarine runoff and temperature stress on local populations of the scleractinian coral species, Montastraea cavernosa, using Tag-Seq global gene expression profiling. In an in situ time series experiment, fate tracked colonies were sampled during periods of relatively low and high estuarine discharge over 4 years to investigate temporal trends in transcriptional patterns and to identify if coral stress indicators were regulated through time. There was significant transcriptomic variation through time, but patterns did not appear to be attributed to distance from nearby estuarine tidal flux. In an ex situ factorial experiment, clonal replicates of coral genotypes were exposed to temperature (25 degrees C and 30 degrees C) and water (offshore and estuarine discharge, representing typical oceanic conditions and episodic discharge conditions, respectively) treatments to quantify the potential individual and synergistic effects of sublethal stress on coral and algal gene expression. Comparative analyses suggested that corals and their algal symbionts were more responsive to thermal stress than to estuarine discharge, although there was evidence of a synergistic relationship between the two stressors. Strong genotype effects also demonstrated that transcriptomic responses to thermal stress were largely based on coral genotype, indicating the potential for stress resilience among certain members of coral populations from southeast Florida.","[Studivan, Michael S.; Shatters, Alycia; Dodge, Danielle L.; Voss, Joshua D.] Florida Atlantic Univ, Harbor Branch Oceanog Inst, Ft Pierce, FL 34946 USA; [Studivan, Michael S.] Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Cooperat Inst Marine & Atmospher Studies, 4600 Rickenbacker Causeway, Miami, FL 33149 USA; [Studivan, Michael S.] NOAA, Atlantic Oceanog & Meteorol Lab, Ocean Chem & Ecosyst Div, Miami, FL 33149 USA; [Beal, Jeff L.] Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservat Commiss, Tallahassee, FL USA; [Beal, Jeff L.] Ducks Unltd, Memphis, TN USA","Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institute Foundation; State University System of Florida; Florida Atlantic University; University of Miami; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Atlantic Oceanographic & Meteorological Laboratory (AOML); Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservation Commission","Studivan, MS; Voss, JD (corresponding author), Florida Atlantic Univ, Harbor Branch Oceanog Inst, Ft Pierce, FL 34946 USA.;Studivan, MS (corresponding author), Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Cooperat Inst Marine & Atmospher Studies, 4600 Rickenbacker Causeway, Miami, FL 33149 USA.;Studivan, MS (corresponding author), NOAA, Atlantic Oceanog & Meteorol Lab, Ocean Chem & Ecosyst Div, Miami, FL 33149 USA.","studivanms@gmail.com; jvoss2@fau.edu","","Voss, Joshua/0000-0002-0653-2767","Florida Sea Grant [R/LR-B-70]; EPA [X700D66717]; NOAA Coral Reef Conservation Program [NA16NOS4820052]; Women Divers Hall of Fame; PADI Foundation; Indian River Lagoon Graduate Research Fellowship","Florida Sea Grant; EPA(United States Environmental Protection Agency); NOAA Coral Reef Conservation Program(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); Women Divers Hall of Fame; PADI Foundation; Indian River Lagoon Graduate Research Fellowship","This study was supported by grants to JV and JB from Florida Sea Grant (R/LR-B-70), EPA (X700D66717), and NOAA Coral Reef Conservation Program (NA16NOS4820052), as well as a donation from the River Branch Foundation and from the Banbury Fund in memory of John and Andreija Robertson to establish the Robertson Coral Reef Research and Conservation Program at Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institute.

Background: Digital transcriptomics is rapidly emerging as a powerful new technology for modelling the environmental dynamics of the adaptive landscape in diverse lineages. This is particularly valuable in taxa such as turtles and tortoises (order Testudines) which contain a large fraction of endangered species at risk due to anthropogenic impacts on the environment, including pollution, overharvest, habitat degradation, and climate change. Sea turtles (family Cheloniidae) in particular invite a genomics-enabled approach to investigating their remarkable portfolio of adaptive evolution. The sex of the endangered loggerhead sea turtle (Caretta caretta) is subject to temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD), a mechanism by which exposure to temperatures during embryonic development irreversibly determines sex. Higher temperatures produce mainly female turtles and lower temperatures produce mainly male turtles. Incubation temperature can have long term effects on the immunity, migratory ability, and ultimately longevity of hatchlings. We perform RNA-seq differential expression analysis to investigate tissue- and temperature-specific gene expression within brain (n = 7) and gonadal (n = 4) tissue of male and female loggerhead hatchlings. Results: We assemble tissue- and temperature-specific transcriptomes and identify differentially expressed genes relevant to sexual development and life history traits of broad adaptive interest to turtles and other amniotic species. We summarize interactions among differentially expressed genes by producing network visualizations, and highlight shared biological pathways related to migration, immunity, and longevity reported in the avian and reptile literature. Conclusions: The measurement of tissue- and temperature-specific global gene expression of an endangered, flagship species such as the loggerhead sea turtle (Caretta caretta) reveals the genomic basis for potential resiliency and is crucial to future management and conservation strategies with attention to changing climates. Brain and gonadal tissue collected from experimentally reared loggerhead male and female hatchlings comprise an exceedingly rare dataset that permits the identification of genes enriched in functions related to sexual development, immunity, longevity, and migratory behavior and will serve as a large, new genomic resource for the investigation of genotype-phenotype relationships in amniotes.","[Chow, Julie C.] Univ Calif Davis, Genome Ctr, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Kyritsis, Nia] Franklin & Marshall Coll, Program Bioinformat, Lancaster, PA 17604 USA; [Mills, Micah] Green Mt Coll, Program Biol Sci, Poultney, VT 05764 USA; [Godfrey, Matthew H.] North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commiss, Sea Turtle Project, Beaufort, NC 28516 USA; [Godfrey, Matthew H.] Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm, Duke Marine Lab, Beaufort, NC 28516 USA; [Harms, Craig A.] North Carolina State Univ, Coll Vet Med, Ctr Marine Sci & Technol, Dept Clin Sci, Morehead City, NC 28557 USA; [Anderson, Paul E.] Calif Polytech State Univ San Luis Obispo, Dept Comp Sci & Software Engn, San Luis Obispo, CA 93407 USA; [Shedlock, Andrew M.] Coll Charleston, Dept Biol, Charleston, SC 29424 USA; [Shedlock, Andrew M.] Med Univ South Carolina, Coll Grad Studies, Charleston, SC 29425 USA; [Shedlock, Andrew M.] Marine Genom Grp, Hollings Marine Lab, Charleston, SC 29412 USA","University of California System; University of California Davis; Franklin & Marshall College; Duke University; North Carolina State University; California State University System; California Polytechnic State University San Luis Obispo; College of Charleston; Medical University of South Carolina","Shedlock, AM (corresponding author), Coll Charleston, Dept Biol, Charleston, SC 29424 USA.;Shedlock, AM (corresponding author), Med Univ South Carolina, Coll Grad Studies, Charleston, SC 29425 USA.;Shedlock, AM (corresponding author), Marine Genom Grp, Hollings Marine Lab, Charleston, SC 29412 USA.","julie.c.chow@gmail.com; nkyritsi@fandm.edu; micahmills90@gmail.com; matt.godfrey@ncwildlife.org; caharms@ncsu.edu; pauleanderson@gmail.com; a.m.shedlock@gmail.com","; Chow, Julie/E-3843-2018","Harms, Craig/0000-0002-1262-9274; Chow, Julie/0000-0003-1900-9737; Shedlock, Andrew/0000-0001-9576-8511","National Science Foundation (NSF) REU Site; NSF Research Infrastructure Improvement Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (SC EPSCoR) [NA10NMF4720035]; SC EPSCoR Institutional Development Award; NOAA Research Grant; US Department of State Fulbright US Scholar; AMS; PEA; MHG; CAH; [11ST53]; [12ST53]; [13ST50]","National Science Foundation (NSF) REU Site(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NSF Research Infrastructure Improvement Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (SC EPSCoR); SC EPSCoR Institutional Development Award; NOAA Research Grant(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); US Department of State Fulbright US Scholar; AMS; PEA; MHG; CAH; ; ;","FundingThis research was funded by National Science Foundation (NSF) REU Site [award DBI-1359301] to [PEA and AMS], Role = student internship training, high-performance computing (HPC) workflow design and implementation, RNA-seq data production and analysis; NSF Research Infrastructure Improvement Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (SC EPSCoR) [award #1317771] to [PEA and AMS], Role = HPC infrastructure and distributed data analysis and management; SC EPSCoR Institutional Development Award (IDeA) Network of Biomedical Research Excellence in Bioinformatics [grant #101-11] to [AMS], Role = HPC infrastructure development and distributed data analysis and management; NOAA Research Grant [award #NA10NMF4720035] to [MHG], Role = sampling design, permit-authorized field collection and experimental treatment of turtles; US Department of State Fulbright US Scholar [Award #29480] to [AMS], Role = Results synthesis and manuscript preparation; and grants from the College of Charleston Office of Faculty Research and Development to [AMS], Role = Project design development and RNA-seq data production.

In the context of our experiment, we found two especially noteworthy results: First, although physiological end points have consistently been shown to be more responsive to warming in similar experimental designs, our study found gene regulation to be considerably more responsive to elevated pCO(2). Furthermore, the combined effect of both stressors on gene regulation was significantly greater than either stressor alone. Using a full factorial experimental design, lobsters were raised in control and elevated pCO(2) concentrations (400 ppm and 1,200 ppm) and temperatures (16 degrees C and 19 degrees C). A transcriptome was assembled from an identified 414,517 unique transcripts. Overall, 1,108 transcripts were differentially expressed across treatments, several of which were related to stress response and shell formation. When temperature alone was elevated (19 degrees C), larvae downregulated genes related to cuticle development; when pCO(2) alone was elevated (1,200 ppm), larvae upregulated chitinase as well as genes related to stress response and immune function. The joint effects of end-century stressors (19 degrees C, 1,200 ppm) resulted in the upregulation of those same genes, as well as cellulase, the downregulation of calcified cuticle proteins, and a greater upregulation of genes related to immune response and function. These results indicate that changes in gene expression in larval lobster provide a mechanism to respond to stressors resulting from a rapidly changing environment.","[Niemisto, Maura; Wahle, Richard A.] Univ Maine, Sch Marine Sci, Darling Marine Ctr, Walpole, ME USA; [Niemisto, Maura; Fields, David M.] Bigelow Lab Ocean Sci, East Boothbay, ME 04544 USA; [Clark, K.

However, the bulk of reef biodiversity resides within the reef framework, and this cryptobiota is fundamentally important for the surface community. Sponges are abundant and conspicuous on the reef surface in productive, continental reefs, but largely vanish from surveys of the oligotrophic reefs of Oceania. However, their diversity in the cryptobiota remains poorly characterized. Here, we explore the contribution of cryptobenthic sponges to overall sponge diversity on 1750 m(2) of reef habitat in KaneModified Letter Turned Commaohe Bay and Waimanalo in the island of OModified Letter Turned Commaahu, HawaiModified Letter Turned Commai. We also assessed cryptic sponges using 15 m(2) of autonomous reef monitoring structures (ARMS) deployed in this same area. We used integrative taxonomy combining morphology, COI and 28S barcoding to delineate and track species, most of which are poorly known or undescribed. We documented 186 OTUs, 150 of which are new records for the Hawaiian Islands, increasing the known sponge fauna of KaneModified Letter Turned Commaohe Bay by 3.5-fold, and that of the Hawaiian Islands by 2.5-fold. More than 3/4 of the sponge OTUs were cryptobenthic. Reef sampling provided access to 31% (44 OTUs), whereas 52% (75 OTUs) were retrieved exclusively from ARMS. These results illustrate that the interstices of ARMS units provide suitable habitat for settlement of cryptobenthic sponges that would otherwise be impossible to access through traditional field surveys. Tracking species with provisional names, using integrative species delineation anchored to vouchers, images, and DNA barcodes provides a powerful approach for working with such a poorly understood fauna.","[Vicente, Jan; Webb, Maryann K.; Jury, Christopher P.; Toonen, Robert J.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Hawaii Inst Marine Biol, Kaneohe, HI 96744 USA; [Paulay, Gustav] Univ Florida, Florida Museum Nat Hist, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Rakchai, Wachirawit] Mahidol Univ, Salaya 73170, Nakhon Pathom, Thailand; [Timmers, Molly A.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Joint Inst Marine & Atmospher Res, Honolulu, HI USA; [Bahr, Keisha] Texas A&M Univ Corpus Christi, Corpus Christi, TX 78412 USA","University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; State University System of Florida; University of Florida; Mahidol University; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University Corpus Christi","Vicente, J (corresponding author), Univ Hawaii Manoa, Hawaii Inst Marine Biol, Kaneohe, HI 96744 USA.","vicentejan@gmail.com","Bahr, Keisha/HHS-1584-2022; Toonen, Rob/V-6230-2019","Webb, Maryann/0000-0001-9528-7486; Vicente, Jan/0000-0003-4741-0261; Bahr, Keisha/0000-0002-8092-833X; Paulay, Gustav/0000-0003-4118-9797","NSF [1612307, 1416889]; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Ocean Acidification Program; Department of Land and Natural Resources Hawaiian Invasive Species Council; Div Of Biological Infrastructure; Direct For Biological Sciences [1612307] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Ocean Acidification Program(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); Department of Land and Natural Resources Hawaiian Invasive Species Council; Div Of Biological Infrastructure; Direct For Biological Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO))","Funding was provided through a combination of NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology (award no. 1612307 to JV and NSF award OA#1416889 to RJT) and by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Ocean Acidification Program.

However, the full extent of variability across the ranges of most coral species remains unknown, especially for corals living in deep waters which span greater ranges. Here, we characterized the microbiomes of four octocoral species from mesophotic and bathyal deep-sea habitats in the northern Gulf of Mexico, Muricea pendula, Swiftia exserta, Callogorgia delta, and Paramuricea biscaya, using 16S rRNA gene metabarcoding. We sampled extensively across their ranges to test for microbiome differentiation between and within species, examining the influence of environmental factors that vary with depth (53-2224 m) and geographic location (over 680 m) as well as the host coral's genotype using RAD-sequencing.Results Coral microbiomes were often dominated by amplicon sequence variants whose abundances varied across their hosts' ranges, including symbiotic taxa: corallicolids, Endozoicomonas, members of the Mollicutes, and the BD1-7 clade. Coral species, depth, and geographic location significantly affected diversity, microbial community composition, and the relative abundance of individual microbes. Depth was the strongest environmental factor determining microbiome structure within species, which influenced the abundance of most dominant symbiotic taxa. Differences in host genotype, bottom temperature, and surface primary productivity could explain a significant part of the microbiome variation associated with depth and geographic location.Conclusions Altogether, this work demonstrates that the microbiomes of corals in deep waters vary substantially across their ranges in accordance with depth and other environmental conditions. It reveals that the influence of depth on the ecology of mesophotic and deep-sea corals extends to its effects on their microbiomes which may have functional consequences. This work also identifies the distributions of microbes including potential parasites which can be used to inform restoration plans in response to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill.","[Vohsen, Samuel A.; Herrera, Santiago] Lehigh Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Bethlehem, PA 18015 USA; [Vohsen, Samuel A.; Herrera, Santiago] Lehigh Univ, Lehigh Oceans Res Ctr, Bethlehem, PA 18015 USA","Lehigh University; Lehigh University","Vohsen, SA; Herrera, S (corresponding author), Lehigh Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Bethlehem, PA 18015 USA.;Vohsen, SA; Herrera, S (corresponding author), Lehigh Univ, Lehigh Oceans Res Ctr, Bethlehem, PA 18015 USA.","sav419@lehigh.edu; santiago.herrera@lehigh.edu","Herrera, Santiago/E-5953-2011","","NOAA","NOAA(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA)","We would like to thank the crews of all research vessels, ROV teams, and the other scientists involved with sampling including Destiny West and Dr. Matt Galaska.

Rock-inhabiting sea pens (rock pens) were first described in 2011; their peduncle is modified into a suction cup-like structure that allows them to attach onto the surface of hard substrates, an adaptation previously unknown in sea pens. There are currently four species that have been identified as rock pens based on their peduncular morphology: three of these are in the genus Anthoptilum (Anthoptilidae), and one in the genus Calibelemnon (Scleroptilidae). Herein, we explore the geographic distribution and depth ranges of rock pens using observations from remotely operated vehicles and investigate the evolutionary origins of the rock pens. We present a phylogenomic study of sea pens, based on DNA sequences from hundreds of ultraconserved elements (UCE) and compare these trees to those constructed using mitochondrial gene regions. Our results show that the ancestral sea pen had a typical elongated peduncle. The adaptation to attach onto hard, rocky substrates using the special suction cup-like peduncle evolved along a single derived lineage that is sister to a lineage comprising the genus Anthoptilum. . We propose all known rock pen species be grouped into a single new genus, described herein, in the family Anthoptilidae, to reflect the phylogenetic history.","[Ganguly, Upasana; France, Scott C.] Univ Louisiana Lafayette, Dept Biol, Louisiana, MO 70504 USA","","Ganguly, U (corresponding author), Univ Louisiana Lafayette, Dept Biol, Louisiana, MO 70504 USA.","upasana.ganguly05@gmail.com; scott.france@louisiana.edu","","Ganguly, Upasana/0000-0002-0128-6835","NOAA Ocean Exploration","NOAA Ocean Exploration(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA)","The authors would like to thank the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of Natural History (NMNH) and California Academy of Sciences (CAS) for giving us access to their collections.

To understand how different coral species and their algal symbionts (family Symbiodiniaceae) respond to this disease, we examine the gene expression profiles of colonies of five species of coral from a SCTLD transmission experiment. The included species vary in their purported susceptibilities to SCTLD, and we use this to inform gene expression analyses of both the coral animal and their Symbiodiniaceae. We identify orthologous coral genes exhibiting lineage-specific differences in expression that correlate to disease susceptibility, as well as genes that are differentially expressed in all coral species in response to SCTLD infection. We find that SCTLD infection induces increased expression of rab7, an established marker of in situ degradation of dysfunctional Symbiodiniaceae, in all coral species accompanied by genus-level shifts in Symbiodiniaceae photosystem and metabolism gene expression. Overall, our results indicate that SCTLD infection induces symbiophagy across coral species and that the severity of disease is influenced by Symbiodiniaceae identity.","[Beavers, Kelsey M.; Van Buren, Emily W.; Emery, Madison A.; MacKnight, Nicholas J.; Dimos, Bradford A.; Mydlarz, Laura D.] Univ Texas Arlington, Dept Biol, Arlington, TX 76019 USA; [Rossin, Ashley M.; Holstein, Daniel M.] Louisiana State Univ, Dept Oceanog & Coastal Sci, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; [Veglia, Alex J.; Karrick, Carly E.; Correa, Adrienne M.

Comparison of neutrophilic Fe oxidizer isolate genomes has revealed a hypothetical Fe oxidation pathway, featuring a homolog of the Fe oxidase Cyc2 from Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans. However, Cyc2 function is not well verified in neutrophilic Fe oxidizers, particularly in Fe-oxidizing environments. Toward this, we analyzed genomes and metatranscriptomes of Zetaproteobacteria, using 53 new high-quality metagenome-assembled genomes reconstructed from Fe mats at MidAtlantic Ridge, Mariana Backarc, and Loihi Seamount (Hawaii) hydrothermal vents. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated conservation of Cyc2 sequences among most neutrophilic Fe oxidizers, suggesting a common function. We confirmed the widespread distribution of cyc2 and other model Fe oxidation pathway genes across all represented Zetaproteobacteria lineages. High expression of these genes was observed in diverse Zetaproteobacteria under multiple environmental conditions and in incubations. The putative Fe oxidase gene cyc2 was highly expressed in situ, often as the top expressed gene. The cyc2 gene showed increased expression in Fe(II)amended incubations, with corresponding increases in carbon fixation and central metabolism gene expression. These results substantiate the Cyc2-based Fe oxidation pathway in neutrophiles and demonstrate its significance in marine Fe-mineralizing environments. IMPORTANCE Iron oxides are important components of our soil, water supplies, and ecosystems, as they sequester nutrients, carbon, and metals. Microorganisms can form iron oxides, but it is unclear whether this is a significant mechanism in the environment. Unlike other major microbial energy metabolisms, there is no marker gene for iron oxidation, hindering our ability to track these microbes. Here, we investigate a promising possible iron oxidation gene, cyc2, in iron-rich hydrothermal vents, where iron-oxidizing microbes dominate. We pieced together diverse Zetaproteobacteria genomes, compared these genomes, and analyzed expression of cyc2 and other hypothetical iron oxidation genes. We show that cyc2 is widespread among iron oxidizers and is highly expressed and potentially regulated, making it a good marker for the capacity for iron oxidation and potentially a marker for activity. These findings will help us understand and potentially quantify the impacts of neutrophilic iron oxidizers in a wide variety of marine and terrestrial environments.","[Mcallister, Sean M.; Chan, Clara S.] Univ Delaware, Sch Marine Sci & Policy, Newark, DE 19716 USA; [Polson, Shawn W.] Univ Delaware, Ctr Bioinformat & Computat Biol, Newark, DE USA; [Butterfield, David A.] Univ Washington, Joint Inst Study Atmosphere & Ocean, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Butterfield, David A.] NOAA, Pacific Marine Environm Lab, 7600 Sand Point Way Ne, Seattle, WA 98115 USA; [Glazer, Brian T.] Univ Hawaii, Dept Oceanog, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Sylvan, Jason B.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Oceanog, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Chan, Clara S.] Univ Delaware, Dept Earth Sci, Newark, DE 19716 USA","University of Delaware; University of Delaware; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of Hawaii System; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; University of Delaware","Mcallister, SM; Chan, CS (corresponding author), Univ Delaware, Sch Marine Sci & Policy, Newark, DE 19716 USA.;Chan, CS (corresponding author), Univ Delaware, Dept Earth Sci, Newark, DE 19716 USA.","mcallis@udel.edu; cschan@udel.edu","Butterfield, David/H-3815-2016; Polson, Shawn/B-7696-2011; Chan, Clara/B-6420-2011","","NSF [OCE-1155290, OCE-1061827, OCE-1031947, EAR-1833525]; ONR [N00014-17-1-2640]; C-DEBI [501]; NOAA/PMEL [5003]; NOAA Ocean Exploration and Research; JISAO [2019-1017]; NIGMS [P20 GM103446]; NASA [NNX10AN63H]; University of Delaware Dissertation Fellowship; Delaware INBRE [NIH NIGMS P20 GM103446]; Delaware Biotechnology Institute; NASA [128257, NNX10AN63H] Funding Source: Federal RePORTER","NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); ONR(United States Department of DefenseUnited States NavyOffice of Naval Research); C-DEBI; NOAA/PMEL(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); NOAA Ocean Exploration and Research(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); JISAO; NIGMS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS)); NASA(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)); University of Delaware Dissertation Fellowship; Delaware INBRE; Delaware Biotechnology Institute; NASA(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA))","This work was funded by NSF OCE-1155290 and ONR N00014-17-1-2640 (to C.S.C.); C-DEBI (contribution no. 501) (to J.B.S.); NSF OCE-1061827 and OCE-1031947 (to B.T.G.); NOAA/PMEL (contribution no. 5003), NOAA Ocean Exploration and Research, and JISAO (contribution no. 2019-1017) (to D.A.B.); NSF EAR-1833525 (to C.S.C. and S.W.P.); and NIGMS P20 GM103446 (to S.W.P.), in addition to two Delaware Space Grant Fellowships (NASA grant NNX10AN63H) and the University of Delaware Dissertation Fellowship to S.M.M.

However, in rapidly changing environments, compensatory mechanisms enabled through plasticity may better promote fitness. Climate change is causing devastating impacts on coral reefs globally and understanding the potential for adaptive and plastic responses is critical for reef management. We conducted a four-year, three-way reciprocal transplant of the Caribbean coral Siderastrea siderea across forereef, backreef, and nearshore populations in Belize to investigate the potential for environmental specialization versus plasticity in this species. Corals maintained high survival within forereef and backreef environments, but transplantation to nearshore environments resulted in high mortality, suggesting that nearshore environments present strong environmental selection. Only forereef-sourced corals demonstrated evidence of environmental specialization, exhibiting the highest growth in the forereef. Gene expression profiling 3.5 years post-transplantation revealed that transplanted coral hosts exhibited profiles more similar to other corals in the same reef environment, regardless of their source location, suggesting that transcriptome plasticity facilitates acclimatization to environmental change in S. siderea. In contrast, algal symbiont (Cladocopium goreaui) gene expression showcased functional variation between source locations that was maintained post-transplantation. Our findings suggest limited acclimatory capacity of some S. siderea populations under strong environmental selection and highlight the potential limits of coral physiological plasticity in reef restoration.","[Castillo, Karl D.] Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Dept Earth Marine & Environm Sci, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Castillo, Karl D.; Bove, Colleen B.; Powell, Maya E.; Davies, Sarah W.] Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Environm Ecol & Energy Program, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Bove, Colleen B.; Hughes, Annabel M.; Davies, Sarah W.] Boston Univ, Dept Biol, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Ries, Justin B.] Northeastern Univ, Dept Marine & Environm Sci, Marine Sci Ctr, Nahant, MA USA","University of North Carolina School of Medicine; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; University of North Carolina School of Medicine; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; Boston University; Northeastern University","Castillo, KD (corresponding author), Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Dept Earth Marine & Environm Sci, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.;Castillo, KD; Bove, CB; Davies, SW (corresponding author), Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Environm Ecol & Energy Program, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.;Bove, CB; Davies, SW (corresponding author), Boston Univ, Dept Biol, Boston, MA 02215 USA.","kdcastil@email.unc.edu; colleenbove@gmail.com; daviessw@bu.edu","Bove, Colleen/AFQ-8778-2022","Hughes, Annabel/0009-0004-3833-9971; Powell, Maya E./0000-0003-4859-0567","NOAA [NA13OAR4310186]; NSF [OCE-1459522, 1357665, OCE-1437371, OCE-1459706]; Life Sciences Research Foundation (LSRF) award - Simons Foundation; Boston University Microbiome Initiative Accelerator grant","NOAA(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Life Sciences Research Foundation (LSRF) award - Simons Foundation; Boston University Microbiome Initiative Accelerator grant","Fieldwork was supported by NOAA award NA13OAR4310186 (to JR and KC) and NSF award OCE-1357665 (to JR).

In this study, the model diatom species, Thalassiosira pseudonana, was grown in nutrient replete and nitrate (NO3-)- and dissolved silicate (Si)-depleted media at three growth temperatures (4, 17, 28 degrees C) to determine how nutrient enrichment and temperature affects diatom growth, photosynthetic efficiency, nitrate reductase (NR) enzyme activity, biogenic silica (bSiO(2)) deposition, and NR gene expression. Growth rates for nutrient-replete cultures were highest at 17 degrees C. Across all nutrient treatments, the cells grown at 17 degrees C had an average Fv/Fm of 0.44 +/- 0.006, while the cells were grown at 4 degrees C and 28 degrees C had an average Fv/Fm of 0.37 +/- 0.004 and 0.38 +/- 0.01, respectively. Activity of NR was variable across treatments with no significant effect of temperature. The relative expression of the targeted NR gene was, on average, similar to 10 times higher in the 4 degrees C cultures and similar to 4 times higher in the 28 degrees C than in the 17 degrees C cultures, while the activity of the NR enzyme was generally highest in the cultures grown at 17 degrees C that were enriched with NO3-. Cells grown under nutrient-replete conditions had significantly higher bSiO(2) deposition rates at 4 degrees C than cells grown at 17 and 28 degrees C.

Understanding and forecasting blooms of these harmful species is a primary management goal. However, accurately predicting the onset and severity of bloom events remains difficult, in part because the underlying drivers of bloom formation have not been fully resolved. Furthermore, Pseudo-nitzschia species often co-occur, and recent work suggests that the genetic composition of a Pseudo-nitzschia bloom may be a better predictor of toxicity than prevailing environmental conditions. We developed a novel next-generation sequencing assay using restriction site-associated DNA (2b-RAD) genotyping and applied it to mock Pseudo-nitzschia communities generated by mixing cultures of different species in known abundances. On average, 94% of the variance in observed species abundance was explained by the expected abundance. In addition, the false positive rate was low (0.45% on average) and unrelated to read depth, and false negatives were never observed. Application of this method to environmental DNA samples collected during natural Pseudo-nitzschia spp. bloom events in Southern California revealed that increases in DA were associated with increases in the relative abundance of P. australis. Although the absolute correlation across time-points was weak, an inde-pendent species fingerprinting assay (Automated Ribosomal Intergenic Spacer Analysis) supported this and identified other potentially toxic species. Finally, we assessed population-level genomic variation by mining SNPs from the environmental 2bRAD dataset. Consistent shifts in allele frequencies in P. pungens and P. subpacifica were detected between high and low DA years, suggesting that different intraspecific variants may be associated with prevailing environmental conditions or the presence of DA. Taken together, this method presents a potentially cost-effective and high-throughput approach for studies aiming to evaluate both population and species dynamics in mixed samples.","[Kenkel, Carly D.; Lorenzen, Nico; Caron, David A.] Univ Southern Calif, Dept Biol Sci, 3616 Trousdale Pkwy, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Smith, Jayme] Southern Calif Coastal Water Res Project, 3535 Harbor Blvd,Suite 110, Costa Mesa, CA 92626 USA; [Hubbard, Katherine A.; Chadwick, Christina] Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservat Commiss, Fish & Wildlife Res Inst, 100 8th Ave SE, St Petersburg, FL 33701 USA; [Hubbard, Katherine A.] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Biol Dept, 266 Woods Hole Rd, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; [Tatters, Avery O.] US Environm Protect Agcy, Gulf Ecosyst Measurement & Modeling Div, 1 Sabine Isl Dr, Gulf Breeze, FL 32561 USA","University of Southern California; Southern California Coastal Water Research Project; Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservation Commission; Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution; United States Environmental Protection Agency","Kenkel, CD (corresponding author), Univ Southern Calif, Dept Biol Sci, 3616 Trousdale Pkwy, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.","ckenkel@usc.edu","Tatters, Avery/V-7723-2019; Kenkel, Carly/AGH-5526-2022","Smith, Jayme/0000-0002-9669-4427","NOAA [NOA18OAR4170073]; California Sea Grant College Program [115697431]; NOAA'S National Sea Grant College Program, U.S. Dept. of Commerce; National Science Foundation [OCE-1840381]; National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences [1P01ES028938]; Woods Hole Center for Oceans and Human Health","NOAA(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); California Sea Grant College Program; NOAA'S National Sea Grant College Program, U.S. Dept. of Commerce; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS)); Woods Hole Center for Oceans and Human Health","This publication was supported by NOAA Grant #NOA18OAR4170073, California Sea Grant College Program Project #115697431, through NOAA'S National Sea Grant College Program, U.S. Dept. of Commerce.

Understanding the connectivity dynamics among these putative refugia and more degraded reefs is critical to develop effective management strategies that promote coral metapopulation persistence and recovery. This study presents a geographically broad assessment of shallow (<30 m) and mesophotic (>30 m) connectivity dynamics of the depth-generalist coral species Montastraea cavernosa. Over 750 coral genets were collected across the Northwest and Southern Gulf of Mexico, Florida, Cuba, and Belize, and similar to 5000 SNP loci were generated to quantify high-resolution genetic structure and connectivity among these populations. Generally, shallow and mesophotic populations demonstrated higher connectivity to distant populations within the same depth zone than to adjacent populations across depth zones. However, exceptions to this pattern include the Northwest Gulf of Mexico and the Florida Keys which exhibited relatively high vertical genetic connectivity. Furthermore, estimates of recent gene flow emphasize that mesophotic M. cavernosa populations are not significant sources for their local shallow counterparts, except for the Northwest Gulf of Mexico populations. Location-based differences in vertical connectivity are likely a result of diverse oceanographic and environmental conditions that may drive variation in gene flow and depth-dependent selection. These results highlight the need to evaluate connectivity dynamics and refugia potential of mesophotic coral species on a population-by-population basis and to identify stepping-stone populations that warrant incorporation in future international management approaches.","[Sturm, Alexis B.; Eckert, Ryan J.; Carreiro, Ashley M.; Klein, Allison M.; Studivan, Michael S.; Farelli, Danielle Dodge; Voss, Joshua D.] Florida Atlantic Univ, Harbor Branch Oceanog Inst, 5600 US 1 North, Ft Pierce, FL 34946 USA; [Studivan, Michael S.] Univ Miami, Cooperat Inst Marine & Atmospher Studies CIMAS, Rosenstiel Sch Marine Atmospher & Earth Sci, Miami, FL USA; [Studivan, Michael S.] Atlantic Oceanog & Meteorol Labs AOML, Miami, FL USA; [Simoes, Nuno] Univ Nacl Autonima Mexico, Fac Ciencias, Unidad Multidisciplinaria Docencia & Invest Sisal, Sisal, Yucatan, Mexico; [Simoes, Nuno] Texas A&M Univ Corpus Christi, Harte Res Inst Gulf Mexico Studies, Int Chair Coastal & Marine Studies, Corpus Christi, TX USA; [Simoes, Nuno] CONACYT, Lab Nacl Resiliencia Costera LANRESC, Labs Nacl, Sisal, Mexico; [Gonzalez-Diaz, Patricia] Univ La Habana, Ctr Invest Marinas, Havana, Cuba; [Mendez, Juliett Gonzalez] Ctr Nacl Areas Protegidas, Havana, Cuba","State University System of Florida; Florida Atlantic University; Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institute Foundation; University of Miami; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Atlantic Oceanographic & Meteorological Laboratory (AOML); Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University Corpus Christi; Universidad de la Habana","Sturm, AB; Voss, JD (corresponding author), Florida Atlantic Univ, Harbor Branch Oceanog Inst, 5600 US 1 North, Ft Pierce, FL 34946 USA.","asturm2017@fau.edu; jvoss2@fau.edu","; Simoes, Nuno/D-9974-2011; Eckert, Ryan/R-5600-2018","Carreiro, Ashley/0000-0001-7204-8239; Simoes, Nuno/0000-0001-7490-3147; Eckert, Ryan/0000-0002-3010-9395; Voss, Joshua/0000-0002-0653-2767; Studivan, Michael/0000-0002-3771-0415; Sturm, Alexis/0000-0003-2153-7811","We thank all who participated in and assisted in the coordination of the NOAA Cooperative Institute for Ocean, Exploration, Research amp; Technology (CIOERT) research cruises and activities where the majority of these samples were collected.

First described in 1958, the vaquita has been in rapid decline for more than 20 years resulting from inadvertent deaths due to the increasing use of large-mesh gillnets. To understand the evolutionary and demographic history of the vaquita, we used combined long-read sequencing and long-range scaffolding methods with long- and short-read RNA sequencing to generate a near error-free annotated reference genome assembly from cell lines derived from a female individual. The genome assembly consists of 99.92% of the assembled sequence contained in 21 nearly gapless chromosome-length autosome scaffolds and the X-chromosome scaffold, with a scaffold N50 of 115 Mb. Genome-wide heterozygosity is the lowest (0.01%) of any mammalian species analysed to date, but heterozygosity is evenly distributed across the chromosomes, consistent with long-term small population size at genetic equilibrium, rather than low diversity resulting from a recent population bottleneck or inbreeding. Historical demography of the vaquita indicates long-term population stability at less than 5,000 (Ne) for over 200,000 years. Together, these analyses indicate that the vaquita genome has had ample opportunity to purge highly deleterious alleles and potentially maintain diversity necessary for population health.","[Morin, Phillip A.; Archer, Frederick I.; Taylor, Barbara L.] NOAA, Southwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, 8901 La Jolla Shores Dr, La Jolla, CA 92120 USA; [Avila, Catherine D.; Fronczek, Julie A.; Houck, Marlys L.; Misuraca, Ann C.; Ryder, Oliver A.] San Diego Zoo Inst Conservat Res, Escondido, CA USA; [Balacco, Jennifer R.; Fedrigo, Olivier; Formenti, Giulio; Haase, Bettina; Mountcastle, Jacquelyn] Rockefeller Univ, Vertebrate Genome Lab, 1230 York Ave, New York, NY 10021 USA; [Bukhman, Yury V.] Morgridge Inst Res, Regenerat Biol, Madison, WI USA; [Chow, William; Howe, Kerstin; Pelan, Sarah; Torrance, James] Wellcome Sanger Inst, Cambridge, England; [Fungtammasan, Arkarachai] DNAnexus, Mountain View, CA USA; [Gulland, Frances M.

Here we present a straightforward approach for species identification in rockfishes using 96 nuclear microhaplotype loci that can be efficiently genotyped using high-throughput DNA sequencing. Self-assignment of nearly 1 000 samples from 54 species resulted in > 99% accurate species identification at a 95% confidence threshold. Phylogenetic relationships of Sebastes uncovered with these same loci were highly concordant with relationships previously derived primarily with mitochondrial DNA. We also assessed ascertainment bias and consequent reduced nucleotide diversity and heterozygosity in non-ascertainment species to understand the potential utility of these markers for those species.

In addition to the biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) encoding known compounds, Microcystis genomes harbor numerous BGCs of unknown function, indicating a poorly understood chemical repertoire. While recent studies show that Microcystis produces several metabolites in the lab and field, little work has focused on analyzing the abundance and expression of its broader suite of BGCs during cyanoHAB events. Here, we use metagenomic and metatranscriptomic approaches to track the relative abundance of Microcystis BGCs and their transcripts throughout the 2014 western Lake Erie cyanoHAB. The results indicate the presence of several transcriptionally active BGCs that are predicted to synthesize both known and novel secondary metabolites. The abundance and expression of these BGCs shifted throughout the bloom, with transcript abundance levels correlating with temperature, nitrate, and phosphorus concentrations and the abundance of co-occurring predatory and competitive eukaryotic microorganisms, suggesting the importance of both abiotic and biotic controls in regulating expression. This work highlights the need for understanding the chemical ecology and potential risks to human and environmental health posed by secondary metabolites that are produced but often unmonitored. It also indicates the prospects for identifying pharmaceutical-like molecules from cyanoHAB-derived BGCs.","[Yancey, Colleen E.; Dick, Gregory J.] Univ Michigan, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Ann Arbor, MI 48104 USA; [Yu, Fengan; Tripathi, Ashootosh; Sherman, David H.] Univ Michigan, Life Sci Inst, Ann Arbor, MI USA; [Tripathi, Ashootosh] Univ Michigan, Nat Prod Discovery Core, Ann Arbor, MI USA; [Tripathi, Ashootosh; Sherman, David H.] Univ Michigan, Dept Med Chem, Ann Arbor, MI USA; [Sherman, David H.] Univ Michigan, Dept Chem, Ann Arbor, MI USA; [Sherman, David H.] Univ Michigan, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Ann Arbor, MI USA; [Dick, Gregory J.] Univ Michigan, Cooperat Inst Great Lakes Res CIGLR, Ann Arbor, MI 48104 USA","University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan","Dick, GJ (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Ann Arbor, MI 48104 USA.;Dick, GJ (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Cooperat Inst Great Lakes Res CIGLR, Ann Arbor, MI 48104 USA.","gdick@umich.edu","Dick, Gregory/D-8901-2012","Dick, Gregory/0000-0001-7666-6288; Yancey, Colleen/0000-0002-6078-9483","NIH [1P01ES028939-01]; NSF [OCE-1840715]; Cooperative Institute of Great Lakes Research [NA17OAR4320152]; Hans W.

Here, we present the first genomic characterization of type D killer whales, a distinctive eco/morphotype with a circumpolar, subantarctic distribution. Effective population size is the lowest estimated from any killer whale genome and indicates a severe population bottleneck. Consequently, type D genomes show among the highest level of inbreeding reported for any mammalian species (F-ROH >= 0.65). Detected recombination cross-over events of different haplotypes are up to an order of magnitude rarer than in other killer whale genomes studied to date. Comparison of genomic data from a museum specimen of a type D killer whale that stranded in New Zealand in 1955, with 3 modern genomes from the Cape Horn area, reveals high covariance and identity-by-state of alleles, suggesting these genomic characteristics and demographic history are shared among geographically dispersed social groups within this morphotype. Limitations to the insights gained in this study stem from the nonindependence of the 3 closely related modern genomes, the recent coalescence time of most variation within the genomes, and the nonequilibrium population history which violates the assumptions of many model-based methods. Long-range linkage disequilibrium and extensive runs of homozygosity found in type D genomes provide the potential basis for both the distinctive morphology, and the coupling of genetic barriers to gene flow with other killer whale populations.","[Foote, Andrew D.] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, NTNU Univ Museum, Dept Nat Hist, Trondheim, Norway; [Alexander, Alana] Univ Otago, Sch Biomed Sci, Dept Anat, Dunedin, New Zealand; [Ballance, Lisa T.; Pitman, Robert L.] Oregon State Univ, Marine Mammal Inst, Newport, OR USA; [Constantine, Rochelle] Univ Auckland, Sch Biol Sci, Auckland, New Zealand; [Constantine, Rochelle] Univ Auckland, Inst Marine Sci, Auckland, New Zealand; [Munoz, Barbara Galletti Vernazzani; Sironi, Mariano] Ctr Conservac Cetacea, Santiago, Chile; [Guinet, Christophe] La Rochelle Univ, Ctr Etud Biol Chize CEBC, CNRS, UMR 7372, Villiers En Bois, France; [Robertson, Kelly M.; Morin, Phillip A.] NOAA, Marine Mammal & Turtle Div, Southwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, La Jolla, CA USA; [Sinding, Mikkel-Holger S.] Univ Copenhagen, Globe Inst, Evolutionary Genom Sect, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Sironi, Mariano] Inst Conservac Ballenas, Buenos Aires, Argentina; [Tixier, Paul] Univ Montpellier, CNRS, IFREMER, IRD,MARBEC, Sete, France; [Totterdell, John] Cetacean Res Ctr CETREC WA, Exmouth, WA, Australia; [Towers, Jared R.] Bay Cetol, Alert Bay, BC, Canada; [Wellard, Rebecca] Project ORCA, Perth, WA, Australia; [Wellard, Rebecca] Curtin Univ, Ctr Marine Sci & Technol, Perth, WA, Australia","Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU); University of Otago; Oregon State University; University of Auckland; University of Auckland; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Ecology & Environment (INEE); National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of Copenhagen; Universite de Montpellier; Ifremer; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Curtin University","Foote, AD (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, NTNU Univ Museum, Dept Nat Hist, Trondheim, Norway.","FooteAD@gmail.com","Towers, Jared/AAJ-5924-2020; Wellard, Rebecca/AAW-7310-2020; Tixier, Paul/AFU-7272-2022; Strander Sinding, Mikkel Holger/B-9450-2015","Foote, Andrew/0000-0001-7384-1634; Alexander, Alana/0000-0002-6456-7757; GUINET, Christophe/0000-0003-2481-6947; Strander Sinding, Mikkel Holger/0000-0003-1371-219X","European Research Council (ERC) [ERC-COG-101045346]; Protected Species Science Branch of NOAA Fisheries Office of Science and Technology; European Union [663830]","European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)); Protected Species Science Branch of NOAA Fisheries Office of Science and Technology(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); European Union(European Union (EU))","ADF was funded by European Research Council (ERC) Consolidator Grant ERC-COG-101045346 EXPLOAD.

Within the Gulf of Mexico (GoM), B. ocellatus and B. robinsi are the most widely distributed species, whose differentiation using morphological characters has been a challenge limiting their accurate identification. Larvae were sampled during two summer seasons (2015 and 2017) in the GoM. Morphological characters allowing identification of both larval species were limited, so they were classified as Bothus spp. Two morphotypes were observed based on the melanophore's presence on the tip of the caudal fin. Species identification was made using a portion of the cytochrome oxidase I (COI) gene. COI sequences for 126 larvae were identified using Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) searches of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) GenBank and the Barcode of Life Data (BOLD) System repositories. COI sequences for larvae and reference sequences from databases were used to build phylogenetic trees and perform genetic distance analyses. COI analyses identified 21 larvae as B. ocellatus and 105 as B. robinsi. Both morphotypes were detected in both species and no diagnostic characteristics were observed. The geographic distribution of the species was similar, but B. robinsi abundance was higher than B. ocellatus in contrast to findings of previous studies. These differences between the results in this study and those of previous ones could have been due to errors in identifications based solely on morphological characters. Therefore, the results obtained demonstrate the power of molecular approaches to improve accuracy of the information generated for Bothus genus larvae.","[Morales-Pulido, J. M.; Galindo-Sanchez, C.

To better understand the genetic underpinnings of these taxonomically and morphologically unique animals, we collected transcriptomic data from several tissue types, mapped them to the recently completed reference genome, and contrasted the patterns observed with comparable data from other elasmobranchs. Evidence of positive selection was detected in 79 genes in P. pectinata, several of which are involved in growth factor/receptor tyrosine kinase signaling and body symmetry and may be related to the unique morphology of sawfishes. Changes in these genes may impact cellular responses to environmental conditions such as temperature, dissolved oxygen, and salinity. Data acquired also allow for examination of the molecular components of P. pectinata electrosensory systems, which are highly developed in sawfishes and have likely been influential in their evolutionary success.","[Jarva, Taiya M.; Phillips, Nicole M.; Von Eiff, Cory; Flynt, Alex S.] Univ Southern Mississippi, Sch Biol Environm & Earth Sci, 118 Coll Dr, Hattiesburg, MS 39406 USA; [Poulakis, Gregg R.] Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservat Commiss, Fish & Wildlife Res Inst, Charlotte Harbor Field Lab, Port Charlotte, FL USA; [Naylor, Gavin] Univ Florida, Florida Program Shark Res, Gainesville, FL USA; [Feldheim, Kevin A.] Pritzker Lab Mol Systemat & Evolut, Field Museum, Chicago, IL USA","University of Southern Mississippi; Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservation Commission; State University System of Florida; University of Florida; Field Museum of Natural History (Chicago)","Flynt, AS (corresponding author), Univ Southern Mississippi, Sch Biol Environm & Earth Sci, 118 Coll Dr, Hattiesburg, MS 39406 USA.","alex.flynt@usm.edu","Phillips, Nicole/AAC-3700-2020","Naylor, Gavin/0000-0002-8731-2626; Poulakis, Ph.D., Gregg/0000-0001-8469-4473; Feldheim, Kevin/0000-0002-5610-9262","National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration [NA16NMF4720062, NA18NMF0080237]; NOAA; University of Florida [ACI 1626217]; National Science Foundation","National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); NOAA(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); University of Florida(University of Florida); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF))","Funding for this project was provided by NOAA Awards NA16NMF4720062 (field work) and NA18NMF0080237 (laboratory processing), and start-up funds from the University of Florida to GN for the long read sequencing and assembly of the reference genome.

Using whole-genome sequencing and tribal fishery sampling of Chinook salmon, we show that a single, small genomic region is nearly perfectly associated with spawning migration timing but not with adiposity or sexual maturity, traits long perceived as central to salmon ecotypes. Distinct migration timing does not prevent interbreeding between ecotypes, which are the result of a simple, ancient polymorphism segregating within a diverse population. Our finding that a complex migratory phenotype results from a single gene region will facilitate conservation and restoration of this iconic fish.","[Thompson, Neil F.; Garza, John Carlos] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Ocean Sci, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Thompson, Neil F.; Anderson, Eric C.; Clemento, Anthony J.; Campbell, Matthew A.; Garza, John Carlos] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Inst Marine Sci, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Thompson, Neil F.; Anderson, Eric C.; Clemento, Anthony J.; Campbell, Matthew A.; Pearse, Devon E.; Garza, John Carlos] Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Southwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Fisheries Ecol Div, Santa Cruz, CA 95060 USA; [Anderson, Eric C.] Colorado State Univ, Dept Fish Wildlife & Conservat Biol, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Campbell, Matthew A.; Pearse, Devon E.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Hearsey, James W.; Kinziger, Andrew P.] Humboldt State Univ, Dept Fisheries Biol, Arcata, CA 95521 USA","University of California System; University of California Santa Cruz; University of California System; University of California Santa Cruz; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Colorado State University; University of California System; University of California Santa Cruz; California State University System; California State Polytechnic University, Humboldt","Garza, JC (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Ocean Sci, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.;Anderson, EC; Garza, JC (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Inst Marine Sci, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.;Anderson, EC; Garza, JC (corresponding author), Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Southwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Fisheries Ecol Div, Santa Cruz, CA 95060 USA.;Anderson, EC (corresponding author), Colorado State Univ, Dept Fish Wildlife & Conservat Biol, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.","eric.anderson@noaa.gov; carlos.garza@noaa.gov","Thompson, Neil/T-9944-2019","Campbell, Matthew/0000-0002-5826-0329; Anderson, Eric/0000-0003-1326-0840; Pearse, Devon/0000-0003-1934-6493; Thompson, Neil/0000-0001-7708-7667","CIMEC (NOAA) award [NA15OAR4320071]; California Sea Grant/Delta Science Fellowship Program [R16AC00026]; Hoopa Valley Tribal Fisheries Project [N04351]","CIMEC (NOAA) award; California Sea Grant/Delta Science Fellowship Program; Hoopa Valley Tribal Fisheries Project","CIMEC (NOAA) award NA15OAR4320071; California Sea Grant/Delta Science Fellowship Program award R16AC00026; Hoopa Valley Tribal Fisheries Project N04351.",NA,43,63,70,1,44,"AMER ASSOC ADVANCEMENT SCIENCE","WASHINGTON","1200 NEW YORK AVE, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20005 USA","0036-8075","1095-9203","","SCIENCE","Science","OCT 30",2020,370,"6516",NA,"","","",609,613,"","10.1126/science.aba9059","http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.aba9059",NA,"",5,"Multidisciplinary Sciences","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Science & Technology - Other Topics","OI1EZ",33122386,"Green Submitted","","","2024-10-25","WOS:000583031800053","View Full Record in Web of Science",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Cyanobacteria were described with the polyphasic approach using morphology, 16S rRNA gene phylogeny, 16S-23S rRNA ITS secondary structures and pairwise distances. Sampling of marine cyanobacteria from seagrasses, lagoons and marine coastal waters from nine Florida localities, in addition to Florida freshwater canals and French salt flats, revealed floating, epipsammic and epiphytic mats.

Over the course of developing the program, data were acquired to determine the optimal way to structure the breeding population for the Eastern oyster, Crassostrea virginica, in the Chesapeake Bay estuary, and how best to implement our now-operational ?industrial breeding? program. Traits studied were survival, total weight, meat yield, and shell shape and decisions were based on estimates of heritability, genetic correlations, and genotype by environment interaction for these traits. Post-hoc, we examined the effect of genetic groups and genetic trends. Genetic variation was abundant and additive, with no evidence of large non-additive effects. Age: age correlations were high, allowing abbreviated field deployment to assess market qualities as early as possible. Survival at high and low salinity were poorly correlated, meaning the gene processes that control survival at each salinity zone are different, and therefore survival at high and low salinities were treated as separate traits. Total weight (indicator of growth rate) was moderately correlated between salinity zones and, while there was some commonality in genetic control across salinities (with 70% of genes in common), total weight was also treated as a separate trait at high and low salinities. Meat yield and shell shape were highly correlated among sites and can therefore be managed as a single trait across all site types. The mass selected lines from our previous work were used as a source of founders, which allowed genetic gains from those lines to be captured in the family program, thus making family-based selection a continuation of previous efforts rather than a restart. The ABC lines have found wide utility not only in the Chesapeake but also in the mid-Atlantic, defined as Rhode Island to South Carolina, USA. Familybased breeding, using the principles encapsulated in this strategy, would be appropriate as a common approach for contiguous breeding efforts for C. virginica along the east coast of the US from the Northeast to the Gulf coasts.","[Allen, Standish K., Jr.; Small, Jessica Moss] Virginia Inst Marine Sci, William & Mary, Aquaculture Genet & Breeding Technol Ctr, POB 1346, Gloucester Point, VA 23062 USA; [Kube, Peter D.] CSIRO, Agr & Food, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia","William & Mary; Virginia Institute of Marine Science; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO)","Allen, SK (corresponding author), Virginia Inst Marine Sci, William & Mary, Aquaculture Genet & Breeding Technol Ctr, POB 1346, Gloucester Point, VA 23062 USA.","ska@vims.edu","Kube, Peter/J-9724-2016","Small, Jessica/0009-0002-2640-8170","NOAA ODRP [NA03OAR4170084]; NOAA Virginia Sea Grant in 2012; VIMS; William & Mary IP Foundation","NOAA ODRP(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); NOAA Virginia Sea Grant in 2012(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); VIMS; William & Mary IP Foundation","Dr. Mark Camara helped initiate family breeding at ABC with funding the NOAA Oyster Disease Research Program funding.

These interactions occur in the microenvironment surrounding phytoplankton cells, known as the phycosphere. Bacteria in the phycosphere use either chemotaxis or attachment to benefit from algal excretions. Both processes are regulated by quorum sensing (QS), a cell-cell signalling mechanism that uses small infochemicals to coordinate bacterial gene expression. However, the role of QS in regulating bacterial attachment in the phycosphere is not clear. Here, we isolated aSulfitobacter pseudonitzschiaeF5 and aPhaeobactersp. F10 belonging to the marineRoseobactergroup and anAlteromonas macleodiiF12 belonging to Alteromonadaceae, from the microbial community of the ubiquitous diatomAsterionellopsis glacialis.We show that only theRoseobactergroup isolates (diatom symbionts) can attach to diatom transparent exopolymeric particles. Despite all three bacteria possessing genes involved in motility, chemotaxis, and attachment, onlyS. pseudonitzschiaeF5 andPhaeobactersp. F10 possessed complete QS systems and could synthesize QS signals. Using UHPLC-MS/MS, we identified three QS molecules produced by both bacteria of which only 3-oxo-C-16:1-HSL strongly inhibited bacterial motility and stimulated attachment in the phycosphere. These findings suggest that QS signals enable colonization of the phycosphere by algal symbionts.","[Fei, Cong; Ochsenkuhn, Michael A.; Shibl, Ahmed A.; Isaac, Ashley; Amin, Shady A.] New York Univ Abu Dhabi, Marine Microbial Ecol Lab, Biol Program, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates; [Fei, Cong; Wang, Changhai] Nanjing Agr Univ, Coll Resources & Environm Sci, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Isaac, Ashley] Univ Bremen, Int Max Planck Res Sch Marine Microbiol, Bremen, Germany","New York University; New York University Abu Dhabi; Nanjing Agricultural University; University of Bremen; Max Planck Society","Amin, SA (corresponding author), New York Univ Abu Dhabi, Marine Microbial Ecol Lab, Biol Program, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates.","samin@nyu.edu","Shibl, Ahmed/K-9703-2019","Ochsenkuehn, Michael/0000-0003-0878-1756; Shibl, Ahmed/0000-0002-8147-8406; Amin, Shady/0000-0003-3780-8102; Isaac, Ashley/0000-0001-9859-4190","China Scholarship Council; NYU Abu Dhabi grant [AD179]; NOAA [NA19NOS4780183]","China Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council); NYU Abu Dhabi grant; NOAA(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA)","The authors would like to thank the China Scholarship Council for the financial support of C.F.

Collecting biological samples from wild marine mammals is both logistically challenging and expensive. To enhance the power of marine mammal research, great effort has been made in both the field and the laboratory to ensure the scientific integrity of samples from collection through processing, supporting the long-term use of precious samples across a broad range of studies. However, identifying the best methods of sample preservation can be challenging, especially as this technological toolkit continues to evolve and expand. Standardizing best practices could maximize the scientific value of biological samples, foster multi-institutional collaborative efforts across fields, and improve the quality of individual studies by removing potential sources of error from the collection, handling, and preservation processes. With these aims in mind, we summarize relevant literature, share current expert knowledge, and suggest best practices for sample collection and preservation.

This study provides a detailed genus and species description and characterizes chloroplast and mitochondrial organellar genomes. The new genus, Anunuuluaehu, shares many characteristics with the family Phyllophoraceae and shows close similarities to Archestennogramma and Stenogramma, including habit morphology, nemathecia forming proliferations at the outer cortex with terminal chains of tetrasporangia, and carposporophytes with multi-layered pericarps. The single species in this genus exhibits distinctive features within the Phyllophoraceae: the presence of single-layer construction of large medullary cells and the development of long, tubular gonimoblastic filaments. Multi-gene phylogenetic analyses confirmed it as a unique, monophyletic lineage within the family. Cis-splicing genes, interrupted by intron-encoded proteins within group II introns, are present in both the chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes of A. liula. Notably, a specific region of the coxI group II intron exhibits similarity to fungal introns. Anunuuluaehu liula is presumed to be endemic to the Hawaiian Archipelago and thus far is known to live solely at mesophotic depths from Holaniku to Kaho'olawe ranging from 54 to 201 m, which is the deepest collection record of any representative in the family. Overall, this study enhances our understanding of the genomic and taxonomic complexities of red algae in mesophotic habitats, emphasizing the significance of continued research in this area to uncover further insights into evolutionary processes and biogeographic patterns.","[Cabrera, Feresa P.; Paiano, Monica O.; Fumo, James T.; Allsopp, Kazumi R.; Smith, Celia M.; Sherwood, Alison R.] Univ Hawaii, Sch Life Sci, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Spalding, Heather L.] Coll Charleston, Dept Biol, Charleston, SC USA; [Kosaki, Randall K.] NOAA, Papahanaumokuakea Marine Natl Monument, Honolulu, HI USA","University of Hawaii System; College of Charleston; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA","Cabrera, FP (corresponding author), Univ Hawaii, Sch Life Sci, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.","feresa@hawaii.edu","Paiano, Monica/HMD-3368-2023","Paiano, Monica/0000-0001-9200-3433; Sherwood, Alison/0000-0001-5079-9621; Kosaki, Randall/0000-0003-1363-5702; Fumo, James/0000-0002-8279-2317; Spalding, Heather/0000-0003-3800-4990","National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument; U.S. National Fish & Wildlife Foundation [DEB -2242142]; U.S. National Science Foundation; [NFWF 0810.20.068602]; [DEB-1754117]","National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); U.S. National Fish & Wildlife Foundation; U.S. National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); ;","National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument; U.S. National Fish & Wildlife Foundation, Grant/Award Number: NFWF 0810.20.068602; U.S. National Science Foundation, Grant/Award Number: DEB-1754117 and DEB -2242142",NA,90,0,0,0,1,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","0022-3646","1529-8817","","J PHYCOL","J.

This process is limited by our understanding of how genetic and genotypic drivers of coral bleaching will manifest in different environmental conditions. We reciprocally transplanted 10 genotypes of Acropora cervicornis across eight sites along a 60 km span of the Florida Reef Tract and documented significant genotype x environment interactions in bleaching response during the severe 2015 bleaching event. Performance relative to site mean was significantly different between genotypes and can be mostly explained by ensemble models of correlations with genetic markers. The high explanatory power was driven by significant enrichment of loci associated DNA repair, cell signalling and apoptosis. No genotypes performed above (or below) bleaching average at all sites, so genomic predictors can provide practitioners with 'confidence intervals' about the chance of success in novel habitats. These data have important implications for assisted gene flow and managed relocation, and their integration with traditional active restoration.","[Drury, Crawford; Lirman, Diego] Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Dept Marine Biol & Ecol, Miami, FL 33149 USA; [Drury, Crawford] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Hawaii Inst Marine Biol, Kaneohe, HI 96744 USA","University of Miami; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa","Drury, C (corresponding author), Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Dept Marine Biol & Ecol, Miami, FL 33149 USA.;Drury, C (corresponding author), Univ Hawaii Manoa, Hawaii Inst Marine Biol, Kaneohe, HI 96744 USA.","crawford.drury@gmail.com","Drury, Crawford/AAR-5935-2020","","Garden Club of America Ecological Restoration Fellowship; MOTE Protect Our Reefs Grant; Paul G.

While it is well accepted that wet weather contributes to this phenomenon, less is understood about the contribution of the complex hydrology in this low-lying coastal plain. A quantitative microbial assessment was conducted in Beaufort, North Carolina to identify trends and potential sources of fecal contamination in stormwater receiving waters. Fecal indicator concentrations were significantly higher in receiving water downstream of a tidally submerged outfall compared to an outfall that was permanently submerged (p < 0.001), though tidal heightwas not predictive of human-specific microbial source tracking (MST) marker concentrations at the tidally submerged site. Short-term rainfall (i.e. <12 h) was predictive of E. coli, Enterococcus spp., and human-specific MST marker concentrations (Fecal Bacteroides, BacHum, and HF183) in receiving waters. The strong correlation between 12-hr antecedent rainfall and Enterococcus spp. (r= 0.57, p< 0.001, n= 92) suggests a predictive model could be developed based on rainfall to communicate risk for bathers. Additional molecular marker data indicates that the delivery of fecal sources is complex and highly variable, likely due to the influence of tidal influx (saltwater intrusion from the estuary) into the low-lying stormwater pipes. In particular, elevated MST marker concentrations (up to 2.56 x 10(4) gene copies HF183/mL) were observed in standing water near surcharging street storm drain. These data are being used to establish a baseline for stormwater dynamics prior to dramatic rainfall in 2018 and to characterize the interaction between complex stormwater dynamics and water quality impairment in coastal NC.

The earliest marine holobiont was likely a syntrophic partnership of at least two prokaryotic members. Since then, symbiosis has enabled marine organisms to conquer all ocean habitats through the formation of holobionts with a wide spectrum of complexities. However, most scientific inquiries have focused on isolated organisms and their adaptations to specific environments. In this review, we attempt to illustrate why a holobiont perspective-specifically, the study of how numerous organisms form a discrete ecological unit through symbiosis-will be a more impactful strategy to advance our understanding of the ecology and evolution of marine life.We argue that this approach is instrumental in addressing the threats to marine biodiversity posed by the current global environmental crisis.","[Gonzalez-Pech, Raul A.; Li, Vivian Y.; Garcia, Vanessa; Boville, Elizabeth; Mammone, Marta; Medina, Monica] Penn State Univ, Dept Biol, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Kitano, Hiroaki] Syst Biol Inst, Tokyo, Japan; [Ritchie, Kim B.] Univ South Carolina, Dept Nat Sci, Beaufort, SC USA","Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park","Gonzlez-Pech, RA (corresponding author), Penn State Univ, Dept Biol, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.","rag5851@psu.edu; vivianli@psu.edu; vpg5102@psu.edu; eboville@psu.edu; mkm7040@psu.edu; kitano@sbi.jp; kritch@uscb.edu; momedinamunoz@gmail.com","Li, Yifan/IAQ-2592-2023; Gonzalez-Pech, Raul Augusto/C-7968-2017","Gonzalez-Pech, Raul Augusto/0000-0001-9808-297X; Li, Yifan (Vivian)/0000-0001-5966-0060; mammone, marta/0000-0002-1371-8041; Garcia, Vanessa/0000-0002-1406-1205","National Science Foundation [OCE 1442206, OCE 1642311]; NOAA Coral Reef Conservation Program [NA19NOS4820132]; Pennsylvania State University","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NOAA Coral Reef Conservation Program(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); Pennsylvania State University","The authors were funded by the National Science Foundation (grants OCE 1442206 and OCE 1642311), the NOAA Coral Reef Conservation Program (grant NA19NOS4820132), and Pennsylvania State University internal funds.",NA,152,5,6,12,22,"ANNUAL REVIEWS","PALO ALTO","4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0139 USA","1941-1405","1941-0611","","ANNU REV MAR SCI","Annu.

While the bacterial genus Endozoicomonas has been widely identified as a dominant associate of tropical and temperate corals, it has rarely been detected in deepsea corals. Determining microbial baselines for these cold-water corals is a critical first step to understanding the ecosystem services their microbiomes contribute, while providing a benchmark against which to measure responses to environmental change or anthropogenic effects. Samples of Acanthogorgia aspera, A. spissa, Desmophyllum dianthus, and D. pertusum (Lophelia pertusa) were collected from western Atlantic sites off the US east coast and from the northeastern Gulf of Mexico. Microbiomes were characterized by 16S rRNA gene amplicon surveys. Although D. dianthus and D. pertusum have recently been combined into a single genus due to their genetic similarity, their microbiomes were significantly different. The Acanthogorgia spp. were collected from submarine canyons in different regions, but their microbiomes were extremely similar and dominated by Endozoicomonas. This is the first report of coral microbiomes dominated by Endozoicomonas occurring below 1000 m, at temperatures near 4 degrees C. D. pertusum from 2 Atlantic sites were also dominated by distinct Endozoicomonas, unlike D. pertusum from other sites described in previous studies, including the Gulf of Mexico, the Mediterranean Sea and a Norwegian fjord.","[Kellogg, Christina A.] US Geol Survey, St Petersburg, FL 33701 USA; [Pratte, Zoe A.] Montana State Univ, Bozeman, MT 59781 USA","United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; Montana State University System; Montana State University Bozeman","Kellogg, CA (corresponding author), US Geol Survey, St Petersburg, FL 33701 USA.","ckellogg@usgs.gov","Kellogg, Christina/B-3257-2009","","National Oceanographic Partnership Program; Bureau of Ocean Energy Management [M17PC00009]; USGS; NOAA Office of Ocean Exploration and Research","National Oceanographic Partnership Program; Bureau of Ocean Energy Management; USGS(United States Geological Survey); NOAA Office of Ocean Exploration and Research(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA)","We thank the captains and crews of the RV `Atlantis' and NOAA ships `Ronald H.

Here we use a different set of metrics, 17 biochemical measures made at the whole tissue or bulk tissue level, to study diversification in resource use and productivity among Pacific mangroves. Three mangrove species Bruguiera gynmorhiza (BRGY), Rhizphora apiculata (RHAP), and Sonneratia alba (SOAL) were studied across 5 sites on the island of Kosrae, Federated States of Micronesia with measurements of the following chemical metrics: C, N, P, K, Na, Mg, Ca, B, S, Mn, Fe, Cu, Zn elements and isotope values delta H-2, delta C-13, delta N-15, and delta S-34. Species were remarkably distinct in chemical profiles, showing significant differences across all metrics. This indicated long-term resource use partitioning and optimization, with metrics showing physiology and patch-related differences. The patch-related differences meant that metrics were not really fixed in species, but represented flexible traits (flexitraits) in fingerprinting mangrove ecology. Effects of tree harvesting could be fingerprinted with the metrics at one of the Kosrae sites. Modeling showed two results. (1) Conservation efforts to preserve low-nutrient specialists like BRGY probably should involve removal of competing SOAL and RHAP rather than nutrient reductions. (2) Although mangrove growth rates were most limited by P, water was a strongly co-limiting factor. This study introduces a new physiological parameter to plant ecology, a water-to-phosphorus ratio, normalized delta C-13/P or f(13C)/P, that should generally help diagnose how plant N and P nutrient use can be co-limited by water.","[Fry, Brian; Cormier, Nicole] USDA Forest Serv, Inst Pacific Isl Forestry, Pacific Southwest Res Stn, Hilo, HI 96720 USA; [Fry, Brian; O'Mara, Kaitlyn] Griffith Univ, Australian Rivers Inst, Nathan, Qld, Australia; [Riekenberg, Philip M.] Royal Netherlands Inst Sea Res NIOZ, Dept Marine Microbiol & Biogeochem, Den Burg, Netherlands; [Wassenaar, Leonard I.] Wassercluster Lunz Biol Stn, Dr Carl Kupelwieser Promenade 5, A-3293 Lunz Am See, Austria; [Cormier, Nicole] Macquarie Univ, Sch Nat Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia","United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Forest Service; Griffith University; Utrecht University; Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea Research (NIOZ); Macquarie University","Fry, B (corresponding author), USDA Forest Serv, Inst Pacific Isl Forestry, Pacific Southwest Res Stn, Hilo, HI 96720 USA.;Fry, B (corresponding author), Griffith Univ, Australian Rivers Inst, Nathan, Qld, Australia.","b.fry@griffith.edu.au","O'Mara, Kaitlyn/KMX-8590-2024; Riekenberg, Philip/ABB-6480-2020","Cormier, Nicole/0000-0003-2453-9900; O'Mara, Kaitlyn/0000-0001-9327-1958","USDA Forest Service, Louisiana SeaGrant Projects [R/CEH-13, R-EFH-07]; NOAA [16OP2670]","USDA Forest Service, Louisiana SeaGrant Projects; NOAA(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA)","This work was supported by the USDA Forest Service, Louisiana SeaGrant Projects R/CEH-13 and R-EFH-07, and NOAA MULTISTRESS award 16OP2670.Open Access funding enabled and organized by CAUL and its Member Institutions",NA,67,0,0,1,11,"SPRINGER","DORDRECHT","VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","0277-5212","1943-6246","","WETLANDS","Wetlands","APR",2023,43,"4",NA,"","","",NA,NA,"31","10.1007/s13157-023-01672-9","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13157-023-01672-9",NA,"",20,"Ecology; Environmental Sciences","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Environmental Sciences & Ecology","C4XM8",NA,"hybrid, Green Published","","","2024-10-25","WOS:000961962200001","View Full Record in Web of Science",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

It can therefore be asked whether genetic changes underlying morphological, physiological, and/or behavioral innovations during evolution occur in a punctual manner, whereby a single mutational event has prominent phenotypic consequences, or if many consecutive alterations in the DNA over longer time periods lead to phenotypic divergence. In the marine teleost, sablefish (Anoplopoma fimbria), complementary genomic and genetic studies led to the identification of a sex locus on the Y Chromosome. Further characterization of this locus resulted in identification of the transforming growth factor, beta receptor 1a (tgfbr1a) gene, gonadal somatic cell derived factor (gsdf), as the main candidate for fulfilling the master sex determining (MSD) function. The presence of different X and Y Chromosome copies of this gene indicated that the male heterogametic (XY) system of sex determination in sablefish arose by allelic diversification. The gsdfY gene has a spatio-temporal expression profile characteristic of a male MSD gene. We provide experimental evidence demonstrating a pivotal role of a transposable element (TE) for the divergent function of gsdfY. By insertion within the gsdfY promoter region, this TE generated allelic diversification by bringing cis-regulatory modules that led to transcriptional rewiring and thus creation of a new MSD gene. This points out, for the first time in the scenario of MSD gene evolution by allelic diversification, a single, punctual molecular event in the appearance of a new trigger for male development.","[Herpin, Amaury; Depince, Alexandra; Guiguen, Yann; Bobe, Julien] INRAE, LPGP, F-35000 Rennes, France; [Herpin, Amaury] Hunan Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci, State Key Lab Dev Biol Freshwater Fish, Changsha 410081, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Schartl, Manfred] Univ Wurzburg, Bioctr, Dev Biochem, D-97074 Wurzburg, Germany; [Schartl, Manfred] Texas State Univ, Xiphophorus Genet Stock Ctr, San Marcos, TX 78666 USA; [Hua-Van, Aurelie] Univ Paris Saclay, CNRS, UMR 9191, IRD UMR 247,Lab Evolut,Genomes Comportement,Ecol, F-91198 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Hayman, Edward S.] NOAA, Ocean Associates Inc, Northwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Seattle, WA 98112 USA; [Octavera, Anna; Yoshizaki, Goro] Tokyo Univ Marine Sci & Technol, Dept Marine Biosci, Tokyo 1088477, Japan; [Nichols, Krista M.] NOAA, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Northwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Conser Vat Biol Div, Seattle, WA 98112 USA; [Goetz, Giles W.] Univ Washington, Cooperat Inst Climate Ocean & Environm Sci, Seattle, WA 98112 USA; [Luckenbach, J.

To better understand the molecular basis of the thermotolerance displayed by these corals, a laboratory-based temperature challenge experiment that also featured conspecifics from a more stress-susceptible offshore reef was conducted with the common Caribbean reef-builder Orbicela faveolata, and the proteomes of both the coral hosts and their endosymbiotic dinoflagellate communities were profiled in (1) controls, (2) corals that succumbed to high-temperature stress and bleached, and (3) those that instead acclimated to high temperatures ex situ. Proteomic signatures varied most significantly across temperatures, host genotypes, and Symbiodiniaceae assemblages, and the two eukaryotic compartments of this mutualism exhibited distinct proteomic responses to high temperatures. Both partners maintained high levels of molecular chaperones and other canonical (eukaryotic) stress response (CSR) proteins in all treatments (including controls). Instead, proteins involved in lipid trafficking, metabolism, and photosynthesis played greater roles in the holobionts' high-temperature responses, and these energy mobilization processes may have sustained the elevated protein turnover rates associated with the constitutively active CSR.","[Mayfield, Anderson B.; Aguilar, Catalina; Kolodziej, Graham] Univ Miami, Cooperat Inst Marine & Atmospher Studies, Miami, FL 33124 USA; [Mayfield, Anderson B.; Aguilar, Catalina; Kolodziej, Graham; Enochs, Ian C.; Manzello, Derek P.] NOAA, Atlantic Oceanog & Meteorol Lab, Miami, FL 33149 USA; [Manzello, Derek P.] NOAA, NOAA Coral Reef Watch, Ctr Satellite Applicat & Res, Satellite Oceanog & Climate Div, College Pk, MD USA","National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Atlantic Oceanographic & Meteorological Laboratory (AOML); National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA","Mayfield, AB (corresponding author), Univ Miami, Cooperat Inst Marine & Atmospher Studies, Miami, FL 33124 USA.;Mayfield, AB (corresponding author), NOAA, Atlantic Oceanog & Meteorol Lab, Miami, FL 33149 USA.","abm64@miami.edu","Kolodziej, Graham/A-3034-2017; Manzello, Derek/A-8661-2014; Aguilar, Catalina/V-7757-2019; Enochs, Ian/B-8051-2014","Aguilar, Catalina/0000-0002-4843-0187; Mayfield, Anderson/0000-0003-0138-7844","NOAA 'OMICs Initiative [NRDD18978]","NOAA 'OMICs Initiative","This project was funded by the NOAA 'OMICs Initiative (Project #NRDD18978 to DM and Kelly Goodwin) .",NA,62,11,13,0,21,"FRONTIERS MEDIA SA","LAUSANNE","AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND","","2296-7745","","FRONT MAR SCI","Front.

Here we show that seasonal and interannual variability in coastal upwelling predicts pelagic ocean microbiome diversity and community structure in the Southern California Current region. Ribosomal RNA gene sequencing, targeting prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbes, from samples collected seasonally during 2014-2020 indicate that nitracline depth is the most robust predictor of spatial microbial community structure and biodiversity in this region. Striking ecological changes occurred due to the transition from a warm anomaly during 2014-2016, characterized by intense stratification, to cooler conditions in 2017-2018, representative of more typical upwelling conditions, with photosynthetic eukaryotes, especially diatoms, changing most strongly. The regional slope of nitracline depth exerts strong control on the relative proportion of highly diverse offshore communities and low biodiversity, but highly productive nearshore communities. Coastal upwelling sustains some of the most productive ocean regions. Here, the authors find that spatial patterns and temporal changes in nutrient supply explain marine microbial community structure and diversity in the Southern California Current region.","[James, Chase C.; Allen, Lisa Zeigler; Lampe, Robert H.; Rabines, Ariel; Schulberg, Anne; Zheng, Hong; Allen, Andrew E.] Univ Calif San Diego, Sect Ecol Behav & Evolut, 9500 Gilman Dr, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [James, Chase C.; Barton, Andrew D.; Allen, Lisa Zeigler; Lampe, Robert H.; Rabines, Ariel; Schulberg, Anne; Goericke, Ralf; Allen, Andrew E.] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, 9500 Gilman Dr, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Barton, Andrew D.] J Craig Venter Inst, 4120 Capricorn Lane, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Goodwin, Kelly D.] Stationed Southwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Atlantic Oceanog & Meteorol Lab, 4301 Rickenbacker Cswy, Miami, FL 33149 USA","University of California System; University of California San Diego; University of California System; University of California San Diego; Scripps Institution of Oceanography; J.

These characteristics helped determine each species' status as a distinct population segment (DPS) under the US Endangered Species Act. Here, we explore larval dispersal patterns and test whether these patterns could explain the differences in population structure. We used a 3-D oceanographic model to simulate dispersal of each species' larvae from sites inside and outside PSGB for up to 120 d. Dispersal patterns were similar across species and site-specific. Most larvae were found in the same DPS region or management basin from which they were released, but dispersal across boundaries was greatest from release sites nearest the DPS boundary for both species. Dispersal of larvae into the DPS from release sites outside the DPS increased and retention of larvae within the DPS increased with increasing pelagic larval duration, but this was also influenced by a simulated ontogenetic shift in larval depth distribution. The proportion of cross boundary dispersal observed for both species was likely high enough by Day 90 to allow gene flow across boundaries, which is consistent with the lack of population structure observed in canary rockfish but conflicts with the differentiated population structure observed in yelloweye rockfish. Understanding the potential larval dispersal pathways within and across management boundaries is an important step in the successful spatial management and recovery of important and protected species.","[Andrews, Kelly; Harvey, Chris J.] NOAA, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Conservat Biol Div, Northwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Seattle, WA 98112 USA; [Bartos, Bradley; MacCready, Parker] Univ Washington, Sch Oceanog, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Tonnes, Dan] NOAA, Protected Resources Div, Fisheries West Coast Reg Off, Seattle, WA 98115 USA; [Bhuthimethee, Mary] NOAA, Oregon & Washington Coast Off, Fisheries West Coast Reg Off, Seattle, WA 98115 USA","National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA","Andrews, K (corresponding author), NOAA, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Conservat Biol Div, Northwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Seattle, WA 98112 USA.","kelly.andrews@noaa.gov","","","National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration's West Coast Regional Office","National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration's West Coast Regional Office(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA)","We thank A.

In order to effectively manage potential exploitation activities, a thorough understanding of the biodiversity, community structure, species ranges, connectivity, and ecosystem functions across a range of scales is needed. The benthic megafauna plays an important role in the functioning of deep-sea ecosystems and represents an important component of the biodiversity. While megafaunal surveys using video and still images have provided insight into CCZ biodiversity, the collection of faunal samples is needed to confirm are very rarely carried out. Using a Remotely Operated Vehicle, 55 specimens of benthic megafauna were-collected from seamounts and abyssal plains in three Areas of Particular Environmental Interest (APEI 1, APEI 4, and APEI 7) at 3100-5100 m depth in the western CCZ. Using both morphological and molecular evidence, 48 different morphotypes belonging to five phyla were found, only nine referrable to known species, and 39 species potentially new to science.

This study examined two wooden deep-sea shipwrecks at 525 and 1800 m water depth and probed their influence on sediment microbiomes and geochemistry. Microbiomes were investigated with 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing along 60 m transects extending in four directions from the hulls of the shipwrecks. Distance from shipwrecks and sediment depth both shaped microbiome structure. Archaeal alpha diversity was significantly and positively correlated with proximity to the deeper shipwreck while bacterial diversity was not to either. Archaeal community structure differed at both sites; the deeper site had a higher proportion of Bathyarchaeia and Lokiarchaeia proximate to shipwreck compared to the shallow location. Major bacterial communities were consistent at both sites, however, at the deeper site had higher abundance of Bacteroidetes, Chloroflexi, Desulfofarculales, and Desulfobacteriales. Core microbiome and differential abundance analyses revealed unique taxa nearest the shipwrecks compared to the surrounding seabed including organoheterotrophs, and cellulolytic and sulfur cycling taxa. Sediment carbon content influenced microbiome structure near the shipwrecks (5-10 m). We show that shipwrecks have a distinct sediment microbiome and form unique habitat patches on seabed, resembling those surrounding organic falls. The shipwreck influence was more pronounced at the deeper site, further from terrestrial influences signaling shipwrecks may be a significant source of organic matter in far-shore oligotrophic settings.","[Hampel, Justyna J.; Moseley, Rachel D.; Mugge, Rachel L.; Ray, Anirban; Hamdan, Leila J.] Univ Southern Mississippi, Sch Ocean Sci & Engn, Div Coastal Sci, Ocean Springs, MS 39564 USA; [Damour, Melanie; Jones, Douglas] Bur Ocean Energy Management, New Orleans, LA USA","University of Southern Mississippi","Hamdan, LJ (corresponding author), Univ Southern Mississippi, Sch Ocean Sci & Engn, Div Coastal Sci, Ocean Springs, MS 39564 USA.","leila.hamdan@usm.edu","","Hampel, Justyna/0000-0002-2869-5807","National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Ocean Exploration and Research Program [NA18OAR0110286]","National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Ocean Exploration and Research Program(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA)","Funding for this study was provided by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Ocean Exploration and Research Program under Cooperative Agreement NA18OAR0110286.

Certain classes of pharmaceuticals, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), are a major environmental concern due to their widespread use and the fact that these compounds are designed to have biological effects at low doses. A complication in predicting toxic effects of SSRIs in nontarget organisms is that their mechanism of action is not fully understood. To better understand the potential toxic effects of SSRIs, we employed an ultra-low input RNA-sequencing method to identify potential pathways that are affected by early exposure to two SSRIs (fluoxetine and paroxetine). We exposed wildtype zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos to 100 mu g/L of either fluoxetine or paroxetine for 6 days before extracting and sequencing mRNA from individual larval brains. Differential gene expression analysis identified 1550 genes that were significantly affected by SSRI exposure with a core set of 138 genes altered by both SSRIs. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis identified 7 modules of genes whose expression patterns were significantly correlated with SSRI exposure. Functional enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes as well as network module genes repeatedly identified various terms associated with mitochondrial and neuronal structures, mitochondrial respiration, and neurodevelopmental processes. The enrichment of these terms indicates that toxic effects of SSRI exposure are likely caused by mitochondrial dysfunction and subsequent neurodevelopmental effects. To our knowledge, this is the first effort to study the tissue-specific transcriptomic effects of SSRIs in developing zebrafish, providing specific, high resolution molecular data regarding the sublethal effects of SSRI exposure.","[Huang, Irvin J.; Dheilly, Nolwenn M.; McElroy, Anne E.] SUNY Stony Brook, Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; [Sirotkin, Howard I.] SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Neurobiol & Behav, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA","State University of New York (SUNY) System; Stony Brook University; State University of New York (SUNY) System; Stony Brook University","McElroy, AE (corresponding author), SUNY Stony Brook, Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA.","anne.mcelroy@stonybrook.edu","dheilly, nolwenn/AAU-9185-2020; Dheilly, Nolwenn Marie/A-7213-2011","Sirotkin, Howard/0000-0002-1428-867X; Dheilly, Nolwenn Marie/0000-0002-3675-5013","New York Sea Grant Institute, a program of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration","New York Sea Grant Institute, a program of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA)","We would like to thank the New York Sea Grant Institute, a program of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, for generously funding this research.

The technical limitations and the high cost of deep sea surveys have made exploring deep sea environments and the biology of the organisms that inhabit them challenging. In spite of the widespread recognition of Cnidaria's environmental importance in these ecosystems, the microbial assemblage and its role in coral functioning have only been studied for a few deep water corals. Here, we explored the microbial diversity of deep sea corals by recovering nucleic acids from museum archive specimens. Firstly, we amplified and sequenced the V1-V3 regions of the 16S rRNA gene of these specimens, then we utilized the generated sequences to shed light on the microbial diversity associated with seven families of corals collected from depth in the Coral Sea (depth range 1309 to 2959 m) and Southern Ocean (depth range 1401 to 2071 m) benthic habitats. Surprisingly, Cyanobacteria sequences were consistently associated with six out of seven coral families from both sampling locations, suggesting that these bacteria are potentially ubiquitous members of the microbiome within these cold and deep sea water corals. Additionally, we show that Cnidaria might benefit from symbiotic associations with a range of chemosynthetic bacteria including nitrite, carbon monoxide and sulfur oxidizers. Consistent with previous studies, we show that sequences associated with the bacterial phyla Proteobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, Planctomycetes and Acidobacteriota dominated the microbial community of corals in the deep sea. We also explored genomes of the bacterial genus Mycoplasma, which we identified as associated with specimens of three deep sea coral families, finding evidence that these bacteria may aid the host immune system. Importantly our results show that museum specimens retain components of host microbiome that can provide new insights into the diversity of deep sea coral microbiomes (and potentially other organisms), as well as the diversity of microbes writ large in deep sea ecosystems.","[Ricci, Francesco; Ainsworth, Tracy] Univ New South Wales, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Kensington, NSW, Australia; [Ricci, Francesco; Pasella, Marisa M.] Univ Melbourne, Sch Biosci, Parkville, Vic, Australia; [Ricci, Francesco] Monash Univ, Biomed Discovery Inst, Dept Microbiol, Clayton, Vic, Australia; [Leggat, William] Univ Newcastle, Sch Environm & Life Sci, Callaghan, NSW, Australia; [Bridge, Tom] Queensland Museum, Museum Trop Queensland, Biodivers & Geosci Program, Townsville, Qld, Australia; [Bridge, Tom; Horowitz, Jeremy] James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld, Australia; [Horowitz, Jeremy] Smithsonian Inst, Natl Museum Nat Hist, Washington, DC USA; [Girguis, Peter R.] Harvard Univ, Dept Organism & Evolutionary Biol, Cambridge, MA USA","University of New South Wales Sydney; University of Melbourne; Monash University; University of Newcastle; Queensland Museum; James Cook University; ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies; Smithsonian Institution; Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History; Harvard University","Ricci, F (corresponding author), Univ New South Wales, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Kensington, NSW, Australia.","francesco.ricci@monash.edu","Horowitz, Jeremy/AAJ-4601-2020","Ricci, Francesco/0000-0003-2501-6925; Girguis, Peter/0000-0002-3599-8160","Schmidt Ocean Institute; NOAA; Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation [9208]","Schmidt Ocean Institute; NOAA(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation(Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation)","The authors thank Ron Thresher from CSIRO for collecting and providing a subset of coral specimens used in this project, Schmidt Ocean Institute and NOAA (https://photolib.noaa.gov/) for providing images a, b, c, e, f and g, and d and h used in Fig. 2, respectively.

We estimated the RRS of Pink Salmon (O. gorbuscha) in Prince William Sound (PWS), Alaska using incomplete pedigrees. In contrast to other RRS studies, Pink Salmon have a short freshwater life history, freshwater habitats in PWS are largely unaltered by development, and sampling was conducted without the aid of dams or weirs resulting in incomplete sampling of spawning individuals. Pink Salmon released from large-scale hatchery programs in PWS have interacted with wild populations for more than 15 generations. Hatchery populations were established from PWS populations but have subsequently been managed as separate broodstocks. Gene flow is primarily directional, from hatchery strays to wild populations. We used genetic-based parentage analysis to estimate the RRS of a single generation of stray hatchery-origin Pink Salmon in two streams, and across the odd- and even-year lineages. Despite incomplete sampling, we assigned 1745 offspring to at least one parent. Reproductive success (RS), measured as sampled adult offspring that returned to their natal stream, was significantly lower for hatchery- vs. natural-origin parents in both lineages, with RRS ranging from 0.03 to 0.47 for females and 0.05 to 0.86 for males. Generalized linear modeling for the even-year lineage indicated that RRS was lower for hatchery-origin fish, ranging from 0.42 to 0.60, after accounting for sample date (run timing), sample location within the stream, and fish length.

Much of the Bay was discolored a dark amber color and raised public concerns as small scale fish kills were reported in a few locations. Light microscopy revealed a monospecific bloom of gymnodinoid dinoflagellates that were previously unknown from the Bay. Gene sequencing of SSU rDNA from cells collected from the bloom confirmed the causative species to be Karenia mikimotoi. This represents the first report of a K. mikimotoi bloom in Alaska. After the bloom organism was confirmed, a K. mikimotoi species-specific qPCR assay was developed and used to assess K. mikimotoi abundances in DNA extracted from phytoplankton samples from Kachemak Bay and Lower Cook Inlet (LCI) obtained over a six-year period. The K. mikimotoi abundances were compared with corresponding time series of environmental variables (water temperature, salinity, water column stability, nutrients, precipitation and wind speed) to assess the factors contributing to the development of the bloom. The results showed early bloom development occurred in August when snow melt reduced salinities and increased water column stability during a period of calm winds. Peak bloom concentrations occurred in late September (10(7) cell eq. L-1) even as water temperatures were decreasing. The bloom gradually declined over the winter but persisted until April of 2014. Karenia mikimotoi cells were not detected two years prior or three years following the bloom, suggesting cells were introduced to Kachemak Bay at a time when conditions allowed K. mikimotoi to thrive.","[Vandersea, Mark; Kibler, Steve; Litaker, R.

Understanding benthic habitat use that is important to the species' reproduction, foraging, and migrations is critical for guiding management decisions. A towed camera-based assessment survey system (C-BASS) equipped with environmental sensors was used to characterize and assess benthic habitats on the West Florida Shelf (WFS) from 2014 to 2018. During these cruises, sea turtles were opportunistically observed during the surveys, and critical in situ data such as spatiotemporal information, species identification, habitat use, behavior, and environmental data were collected and evaluated. In total, 79 sea turtles were observed during 97 transects of approximately 2700 km of seafloor, which was recorded on 380 h of video. Several sea turtle species were spotted within the WFS, including loggerhead Caretta caretta, Kemp's ridley Lepidochelys kempii, and green turtles Chelonia mydas. These opportunistic sightings revealed an area of high use on the WFS, an anthropogenic structure known as the Gulf-stream natural gas pipeline (GSPL). C-BASS survey results suggest that 2 sea turtle species (C. caretta and L. kempii) utilize this artificial structure primarily as a resting area. We emphasize the importance of combining habitat mapping techniques (towed underwater video and multibeam bathymetry/backscatter) with tracking technology to better understand the fine-scale habitat use of sea turtles.","[Broadbent, Heather A.; Grasty, Sarah E.; Lembke, Chad; Brizzolara, Jennifer L.; Murawski, Steven] Univ S Florida, Coll Marine Sci, St Petersburg, FL 33701 USA; [Hardy, Robert F.] Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservat Commiss, Fish & Wildlife Res Inst, St Petersburg, FL 33701 USA; [Lamont, Margaret M.] US Geol Survey, Wetland & Aquat Res Ctr, Gainesville, FL 32653 USA; [Hart, Kristen M.] US Geol Survey, Wetland & Aquat Res Ctr, Davie, FL 33314 USA","State University System of Florida; University of South Florida; Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservation Commission; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey","Broadbent, HA (corresponding author), Univ S Florida, Coll Marine Sci, St Petersburg, FL 33701 USA.","hbroadbent@mail.usf.edu","Hardy, Robert/I-3102-2019","Hardy, Robert/0000-0002-3178-2397; Grasty, Sarah/0009-0003-3255-8025; Murawski, Steven/0000-0001-7002-4356","National Fish and Wildlife Foundation's (NFWF) Gulf Environmental Benefit Fund [45892]; NOAA's Advanced Sampling Technology Working Group (ASTWG) [NA11NMF4720284]","National Fish and Wildlife Foundation's (NFWF) Gulf Environmental Benefit Fund; NOAA's Advanced Sampling Technology Working Group (ASTWG)","This work was supported by the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation's (NFWF) Gulf Environmental Benefit Fund (grant number 45892).

We developed a high-resolution hybridization-based genotype array coupled with an analysis workflow and database for the most speciose genus of coral, Acropora, and their symbionts. We designed the array to co-analyze host and symbionts based on bi-allelic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) markers identified from genomic data of the two Caribbean Acropora species as well as their dominant dinoflagellate symbiont, Symbiodinium 'fitti'. SNPs were selected to resolve multi-locus genotypes of host (called genets) and symbionts (called strains), distinguish host populations and determine ancestry of coral hybrids between Caribbean acroporids. Pacific acroporids can also be genotyped using a subset of the SNP loci and additional markers enable the detection of symbionts belonging to the genera Breviolum, Cladocopium, and Durusdinium. Analytic tools to produce multi-locus genotypes of hosts based on these SNP markers were combined in a workflow called the Standard Tools for Acroporid Genotyping (STAG). The STAG workflow and database are contained within a customized Galaxy environment (https://coralsnp.science.psu.edu/galaxy/), which allows for consistent identification of host genet and symbiont strains and serves as a template for the development of arrays for additional coral genera. STAG data can be used to track temporal and spatial changes of sampled genets necessary for restoration planning and can be applied to downstream genomic analyses. Using STAG, we uncover bi-directional hybridization between and population structure within Caribbean acroporids and detect a cryptic Acroporid species in the Pacific.","[Kitchen, S. A.; Kuntz, K. L.

In particular, rapid evolutionary divergence between populations has been shown to impact the ecology of populations, communities, and ecosystems. While studies have focused largely on the role of adaptive divergence in generating ecologically important variation among populations, much less is known about the role of gene flow in shaping ecological outcomes. After divergence, populations may continue to interact through gene flow, which may influence evolutionary and ecological processes. Here, we investigate the role of gene flow in shaping the contemporary evolution and ecology of recently diverged populations of anadromous steelhead and resident rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). Results show that resident rainbow trout introduced above waterfalls have diverged evolutionarily from downstream anadromous steelhead, which were the source of introductions. However, the movement of fish from above to below the waterfalls has facilitated gene flow, which has reshaped genetic and phenotypic variation in the anadromous source population. In particular, gene flow has led to an increased frequency of residency, which in turn has altered population density, size structure, and sex ratio. This result establishes gene flow as a contemporary evolutionary process that can have important ecological outcomes. From a management perspective, anadromous steelhead are generally regarded as a higher conservation priority than resident rainbow trout, even when found within the same watershed. Our results show that anadromous and resident O. mykiss populations may be connected via gene flow, with important ecological consequences. Such eco-evolutionary processes should be considered when managing recently diverged populations connected by gene flow.","[Kobayashi, Katie M.; Palkovacs, Eric P.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Santa Cruz, CA 95060 USA; [Kobayashi, Katie M.; Bond, Rosealea M.; Garza, J.

The abundance of V. vulnificus, as determined by quantitative PCR (qPCR) of the hemolysin gene (vvhA), varied spatially and temporally by nearly 4 orders of magnitude (<= 3 to 14,000 mL(-1)). Unlike in temperate and subtropical systems, temperatures were persistently warm (19 to 31 degrees C) and explained little of the variability in V. vulnificus abundance. Salinity (1 to 36 ppt) had a significant, but nonlinear, relationship with V. vulnificus abundance with the highest vvhA concentrations (>2,500 mL(-1)) observed only at salinities from 7 to 22 ppt. V. vulnificus abundances were lower on average during the summer dry season, when waters were warmer but more saline. The highest canal-wide average abundances were observed during a time of modest rainfall, when moderate salinities and elevated concentrations of reduced nitrogen species and silica suggested a groundwater influence. Parallel quantification of the vcgC gene suggested that C-type strains, which are responsible for most human infections, comprised 25% of the total V. vulnificus on average, but their relative contribution was greater at higher salinities, suggesting a broader salinity tolerance. Generalized regression models suggested that up to 67% of sample-to-sample variation (n = 202) in log-transformed V. vulnificus abundance was explained using the measured environmental variables, and up to 97% of the monthly variation in canal-wide average concentrations (n = 13) was explained with the best subset of four variables. IMPORTANCE Our data illustrate that, in the absence of strong seasonal variation in water temperature in the tropics, variation in salinity driven by rainfall becomes a primary controlling variable on V. vulnificus abundance. There is thus a tendency for a rainfall-driven seasonal cycle in V. vulnificus abundance which is inverted from the temperature-driven seasonal cycle at higher latitudes. However, stochasticity in rainfall and its nonlinear, indirect effects on V. vulnificus concentration means that high abundances can occur at any location in the canal at any time of year, making it challenging to predict concentrations of this pathogen at a high temporal or spatial resolution. Much of the variability in canal-wide average concentrations, on the other hand, was explained by a few variables that reflect the magnitude of freshwater input to the system, suggesting that relative risk of exposure to this pathogen could be predicted as an average for the system.","[Nigro, Olivia D.] Hawaii Pacific Univ, Dept Nat Sci, Honolulu, HI USA; [James-Davis, La'Toya, I; Steward, Grieg F.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Daniel K Inouye Ctr Microbial Oceanog Res & Educ, Sch Ocean & Earth Sci & Technol SOEST, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [James-Davis, La'Toya, I; De Carlo, Eric Heinen; Li, Yuan-Hui; Steward, Grieg F.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Oceanog, Sch Ocean & Earth Sci & Technol SOEST, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [James-Davis, La'Toya, I] JBSA Ft Sam Houston, San Antonio, TX USA","Hawaii Pacific University; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa","Steward, GF (corresponding author), Univ Hawaii Manoa, Daniel K Inouye Ctr Microbial Oceanog Res & Educ, Sch Ocean & Earth Sci & Technol SOEST, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.;Steward, GF (corresponding author), Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Oceanog, Sch Ocean & Earth Sci & Technol SOEST, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.","grieg@hawaii.edu","; Steward, Grieg/D-9768-2011","Nigro, Olivia/0000-0003-2646-0745; Steward, Grieg/0000-0001-5988-0522","Hawai'i Sea Grant (2009, 2012); National Science Foundation [OCE05-54768, OCE08-26650]; NOAA Ocean Observing System [NA07NOS4730207]","Hawai'i Sea Grant (2009, 2012); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NOAA Ocean Observing System(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA)","This work was supported by grants from the Hawai'i Sea Grant (2009, 2012), the National Science Foundation (OCE05-54768, OCE08-26650) and the NOAA Ocean Observing System (NA07NOS4730207).",NA,58,7,7,0,7,"AMER SOC MICROBIOLOGY","WASHINGTON","1752 N ST NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036-2904 USA","0099-2240","1098-5336","","APPL ENVIRON MICROB","Appl.

This review provides my perspective on the field during this period, integrating fundamental and applied developments and milestones. Our basic understanding of the brain-pituitary-gonadal axis led to overcoming the failure of farmed fish to ovulate and spawn in captivity, allowing us to close the fish life cycle and establish a predictable, year-round production of eggs. Dissecting the molecular and hormonal mechanisms associated with sex determination and differentiation drove technologies for producing better performing mono-sex and reproductively-sterile fish. The growing contingent of passionate fish biologists, together with the availability of innovative platforms such as transgenesis and gene editing, as well as new models such as the zebrafish and medaka, have generated many discoveries, also leading to new insights of reproductive biology in higher vertebrates including humans. Consequently, fish have now been widely accepted as vertebrate reproductive models. Perhaps the best testament of the progress in our discipline is demonstrated at the International Symposia on Reproductive Physiology of Fish (ISRPF), at which our scientific family has convened every four years since the grandfather of the field, the late Ronald Billard, organized the inaugural 1977 meeting in Paimpont, France. As the one person who has been fortunate enough to attend all of these meetings since their inception, I have witnessed first-hand the astounding evolution of our field as we capitalized on the molecular and biotechnological revolutions in the life sciences, which enabled us to provide a higher resolution of fish reproductive and endocrine processes, answer more questions, and dive into deeper comprehension. Undoubtedly, the next (five) decades will be similarly exciting as we continue to integrate physiology with genomics, basic and translational research, and the small fish models with the aquacultured species.","[Zohar, Yonathan] Univ Maryland Baltimore Cty, Inst Marine & Environm Technol, Dept Marine Biotechnol, Baltimore, MD 21202 USA","University System of Maryland; University of Maryland Baltimore; University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science; Institute of Marine & Environmental Technology; University of Maryland Baltimore County","Zohar, Y (corresponding author), Univ Maryland Baltimore Cty, Inst Marine & Environm Technol, Dept Marine Biotechnol, Baltimore, MD 21202 USA.","","","Reis, AlessanRSS/0000-0001-8486-7469","NSF; NOAA; National Sea Grant; Maryland Sea Grant; USDA; US-Israel BARD; Israel Science Foundation; NOAA-SK; UDSA-SBIR; Gudelsky Family Foundation","NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NOAA(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); National Sea Grant; Maryland Sea Grant; USDA(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)); US-Israel BARD(US-Israel Binational Science Foundation); Israel Science Foundation(Israel Science Foundation); NOAA-SK; UDSA-SBIR; Gudelsky Family Foundation","Throughout my career, I have been consistently funded by many US and international funding agencies, including NSF, NOAA, National Sea Grant, Maryland Sea Grant, USDA, US-Israel BARD, Israel Science Foundation, NOAA-SK, UDSA-SBIR, the Gudelsky Family Foundation and many others.

Consequently, we know relatively little about the changes underway at real-world scales of biological communities, which typically have hundreds or thousands of interacting species. Here, we use COI mtDNA amplicons from monthly samples of environmental DNA to survey 221 planktonic taxa along a gradient of temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen and carbonate chemistry in nearshore marine habitat. The result is a high-resolution picture of changes in ecological communities using a technique replicable across a wide variety of ecosystems. We estimate community-level differences associated with time, space and environmental variables, and use these results to forecast near-term community changes due to warming and ocean acidification. We find distinct communities in warmer and more acidified conditions, with overall reduced richness in diatom assemblages and increased richness in dinoflagellates. Individual taxa finding more suitable habitat in near-future waters are more taxonomically varied and include the ubiquitous coccolithophore Emiliania huxleyi and the harmful dinoflagellate Alexandrium sp.

Among 2 sympatric pinniped species that differ in sociality and putative disease exposure, we investigate observed differences in susceptibility through an analysis of a highly variable, duplicated gene family involved in the vertebrate immune response. Using high-throughput amplicon sequencing, we characterize diversity at the 2 exons that encode the peptide binding region of the major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) gene in harbor (N = 60) and gray (N = 90) seal populations from the Northwest Atlantic. Across species, we identified 106 full-length exon 2 and 103 exon 3 sequence variants and a minimum of 11 duplicated MHC-I loci. The sequence variants clustered in 15 supertypes defined by the physiochemical properties of the peptide binding region, including a putatively novel Northwest Atlantic MHC-I diversity sublineage. Trans-species polymorphisms, dN/dS ratios, and evidence of gene conversion among supertypes are consistent with balancing selection acting on this gene. High functional redundancy suggests particularly strong selection among gray seals at the novel Northwest Atlantic MHC-I diversity sublineage. At exon 2, harbor seals had a significantly greater number of variants per individual than gray seals, but fewer supertypes. Supertype richness and private supertypes are hypothesized to contribute to observed differences in disease resistance between species, as consistently, across the North Atlantic and many disease outbreaks, gray seals appear to be more resistant to respiratory viruses than harbor seals.","[Gigliotti, Alayna K.; Cammen, Kristina M.] Univ Maine, Sch Marine Sci, Orono, ME 04469 USA; [Bowen, W.

In the Milwaukee Estuary (Wisconsin, USA), previous studies have used a nontargeted metabolomic approach to distinguish between zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) collected from sites of varying contamination. To further elucidate the potential effects of contaminants on bivalve health in the Milwaukee Estuary, the present study adopted a caging approach to study the metabolome of quagga mussels (Dreissena bugensis rostriformis) deployed in six sites of varying contamination for 2, 5, or 55 days. Caged mussels were co-deployed with two types of passive sampler (polar organic chemical integrative samplers and semipermeable membrane devices) and data loggers. In conjunction, in situ quagga mussels were collected from the four sites studied previously and analyzed for residues of contaminants and metabolomics using a targeted approach. For the caging study, temporal differences in the metabolomic response were observed with few significant changes observed after 2 and 5 days, but larger differences (up to 97 significantly different metabolites) to the metabolome in all sites after 55 days. A suite of metabolic pathways were altered, including biosynthesis and metabolism of amino acids, and upmodulation of phospholipids at all sites, suggesting a potential biological influence such as gametogenesis. In the caging study, average temperatures appeared to have a greater effect on the metabolome than contaminants, despite a large concentration gradient in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons residues measured in passive samplers and mussel tissue. Conversely, significant differences between the metabolome of mussels collected in situ from all three contaminated sites and the offshore reference site were observed. Overall, these findings highlight the importance of contextualizing the effects of environmental conditions and reproductive processes on the metabolome of model organisms to facilitate the wider use of this technique for biomonitoring and environmental health assessments.

Despite conventional tagging efforts off Hawaii, striped marlin movements are not known across the broader Pacific, and little research has been conducted since 2005. To address this gap, 31 popup satellite archival tags (PSAT) were deployed on striped marlin (138-192 cm eye fork length) between 2016 and 2019 via the Hawaii-based longline fleet. To complement tagging efforts, 148 fin clips were also collected for genetic analyses during June-August 2017. Tag attachments ranged from 1-365 days (median = 74), where mechanical failures and non-reporting tags lowered expected data returns. Striped marlin tracks revealed extensive spatial use of the Central Pacific, spanning 15 degrees S to 43 degrees N and 122 to 170 degrees W, showing diverse seasonal dispersal patterns and individual movements, and some coincided in time and space with known spawning grounds. Genetic profiles of 55 Hawaii-landed striped marlin were assigned to two genetic groups: Australia, New Zealand and Hawaii (n = 19), and Hawaii alone (n=36), suggesting the Hawaii-based longline fleet interacted with individuals from multiple populations.A year-long track confirmed migration between the Central North Pacific and Australia (>9,400 km), and combined with genetic results, is the first to document regional connectivity. By combining tools from conventional and electronic tags, biological sampling, and genomic techniques, a more holistic understanding emerges, suggesting that striped marlin should be collectively managed. Under global warming scenarios and changing pelagic ecosystems, integrative knowledge is critical for designing effective management strategies for rebuilding sustainable populations across the Pacific Ocean.","[Lam, Chi Hin; Lutcavage, Molly E.] Large Pelag Res Ctr, United State, Gloucester, MA USA; [Lam, Chi Hin; Tam, Clayward; Lutcavage, Molly E.] Pacific Isl Fisheries Grp, Kailua, HI USA","","Lam, CH (corresponding author), Large Pelag Res Ctr, United State, Gloucester, MA USA.;Lam, CH (corresponding author), Pacific Isl Fisheries Grp, Kailua, HI USA.","","","","NOAA Cooperative Research Program; [NA15NMF4720395]","NOAA Cooperative Research Program(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA);","This research was funded by NOAA Cooperative Research Program award # NA15NMF4720395 to the Pacific Islands Fisheries Group.",NA,47,5,5,2,15,"FRONTIERS MEDIA SA","LAUSANNE","AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND","","2296-7745","","FRONT MAR SCI","Front.

Interspecific hybridization can facilitate gene flow between parent species or produce novel taxa that may alter invasion dynamics or ecosystem services. The coastal sand dunes of the U.S. Pacific Northwest coast are densely populated by two non-native, congeneric, dune-building beachgrasses (Ammophila arenaria and A. breviligulata). Here, we present morphological, cytological, and genetic evidence that the two beachgrass species have hybridized in this globally unique range overlap. The A. arenaria x A. breviligulata hybrid has been found at 12 coastal sites in Washington and Oregon. It is a first-generation hybrid between the beachgrass species as evidenced by genome size comparisons and single nucleotide polymorphism genotyping. It is intermediate between the parent grasses in many morphological characters but exceeds both parents in shoot height, a trait associated with dune-building potential. Understanding the ecological and population genetic consequences of this novel hybridization event is of the utmost importance in a system where any change in dominant beachgrass species can have large effects on both biodiversity management and coastal protection.","[Mostow, Rebecca S.; Barreto, Felipe; Biel, Reuben; Meyer, Eli; Hacker, Sally D.] Oregon State Univ, Dept Integrat Biol, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA","Oregon State University","Mostow, RS (corresponding author), Oregon State Univ, Dept Integrat Biol, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.","mostowr@oregonstate.edu","","Mostow, Rebecca/0000-0002-4136-0825","NSF Graduate Research Fellowship; Washington Native Plant Society; NOAA Oregon Sea Grant [NA18OAR4170072]","NSF Graduate Research Fellowship(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Washington Native Plant Society; NOAA Oregon Sea Grant(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA)","We thank Dr. R.

Assessments of marine microbial diversity are therefore critical to understanding spatiotemporal variations in microbial community structure and function in ocean ecosystems. With recent advances in DNA shotgun sequencing for metagenome samples and computational analysis, it is now possible to access the taxonomic and genomic content of ocean microbial communities to study their structural patterns, diversity, and functional potential. However, existing taxonomic classification tools depend upon manually curated phylogenetic trees, which can create inaccuracies in metagenomes from less well-characterized communities, such as from ocean water. Herein, we explore the utility of deep learning tools-DeepMicrobes and a novel Residual Network architecture-that leverage natural language processing and convolutional neural network architectures to map input sequence data (k-mers) to output labels (taxonomic groups) without reliance on a curated taxonomic tree. We trained both models using metagenomic reads simulated from marine microbial genomes in the MarRef database. The performance of both models (accuracy, precision, and percent microbe predicted) was compared with the standard taxonomic classification tool Kraken2 using 10 complex metagenomic data sets simulated from MarRef. Our results demonstrate that time, compute power, and microbial genomic diversity still pose challenges for machine learning (ML). Moreover, our results suggest that high genome coverage and rectification of class imbalance are prerequisites for a well-trained model, and therefore should be a major consideration in future ML work. IMPORTANCE Taxonomic profiling of microbial communities is essential to model microbial interactions and inform habitat conservation. This work develops approaches in constructing training/testing data sets from publicly available marine metagenomes and evaluates the performance of machine learning (ML) approaches in read-based taxonomic classification of marine metagenomes. Predictions from two models are used to test accuracy in metagenomic classification and to guide improvements in ML approaches. Our study provides insights on the methods, results, and challenges of deep learning on marine microbial metagenomic data sets. Future machine learning approaches can be improved by rectifying genome coverage and class imbalance in the training data sets, developing alternative models, and increasing the accessibility of computational resources for model training and refinement.","[Park, Helen] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Life Sci, Ctr Synthet & Syst Biol, Tsinghua Peking Ctr Life Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Park, Helen] Univ Manchester, EPSRC Synthet Biol Res Ctr SYNBIOCHEM, EPSRC BBSRC Future Biomanufacturing Res Hub, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Park, Helen] Univ Manchester, Sch Chem, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Lim, Shen Jean; Montes, Enrique] Univ Miami, Cooperat Inst Marine & Atmospher Studies, Rosenstiel Sch Marine Atmospher & Earth Sci, Miami, FL USA; [Lim, Shen Jean; Montes, Enrique; Thompson, Luke R.] NOAA, Ocean Chem & Ecosystems Div, Atlant Oceanog & Meteorol Lab, Miami, FL 33165 USA; [Lim, Shen Jean] Univ S Florida, Coll Marine Sci, St Petersburg, FL USA; [Cosme, Jonathan] Run AI, Off CTO, Tel Aviv, Israel; [O'Connell, Kyle; Fisher, Sam] Deloitte Consulting LLP, Biomed Data Sci Team, Arlington, VA USA; [O'Connell, Kyle] Smithsonian Inst, Dept Vertebrate Zool, Natl Museum Nat Hist, Washington, DC USA; [Sandeep, Jilla; Gayanilo, Felimon] Texas A&M Univ Corpus Christi, Harte Res Inst, Corpus Christi, TX USA; [Cutter, George R., Jr.] NOAA, Southwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Antarctic Ecosyst Res Div, La Jolla, CA USA; [Nitikitpaiboon, Chotinan] Univ Tokyo, Dept Computat Biol & Med Sci, Grad Sch Frontier Sci, Tokyo, Japan; [Moustahfid, Hassan] NOAA, US Integrated Ocean Observing Syst IOOS, Silver Spring, MD USA; [Thompson, Luke R.] Mississippi State Univ, Northern Gulf Inst, Mississippi State, MS USA","Tsinghua University; University of Manchester; University of Manchester; University of Miami; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Atlantic Oceanographic & Meteorological Laboratory (AOML); State University System of Florida; University of South Florida; Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Limited; Smithsonian Institution; Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University Corpus Christi; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of Tokyo; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Mississippi State University","Thompson, LR (corresponding author), NOAA, Ocean Chem & Ecosystems Div, Atlant Oceanog & Meteorol Lab, Miami, FL 33165 USA.","luke.thompson@noaa.gov","Thompson, Luke/Z-3344-2019; Lim, Jean/AFE-9228-2022","Lim, Shen Jean/0000-0003-4578-5318","National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration [NA21OAR4320190]; DOC \ National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) [NA20OAR4320472]","National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); DOC \ National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA)","National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration NA21OAR4320190 Luke R.

These phycotoxins are produced by Gambierdiscus spp., tropical epiphytic dinoflagellates that live on a variety of macrophytes, as well as on dead corals and sand. Recent taxonomic studies have identified novel diversity within the Gambierdiscus genus, with at least 18 species and several sub-groups now identified, many of which co-occur and differ significantly in toxicity. The ability to accurately and quickly distinguish Gambierdiscus species in field samples and determine community composition and abundance is central to assessing CP risk, yet most Gambierdiscus species are indistinguishable using light microscopy, and other enumeration methods are semi-quantitative. In order to investigate the spatial and temporal dynamics of Gambierdiscus species and community toxicity, new tools for species identification and enumeration in field samples are needed. Here, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) probes were designed for seven species commonly found in the Caribbean Sea and Pacific Ocean, permitting their enumeration in field samples using epifluorescence microscopy. This technique enables the assessment of community composition and accurate determination of cell abundances of individual species. Molecular probes detecting G. australes, G. belizeanus, G. caribaeus, G. carolinianus, G. carpenteri, and the G. silvae/G. polynesiensis clade were designed using alignments of large subunit ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequences. These probes were tested for specificity and cross reactivity through experiments in which field samples were spiked with known concentrations of Gambierdiscus cultures, and analyzed to confirm that Gambierdiscus can be successfully detected and enumerated by FISH in the presence of detritus and other organisms. These probes were then used to characterize Gambierdiscus community structure in field samples collected from the Florida Keys and Hawai'i, USA. The probes revealed the co occurrence of multiple species at each location. Time-series FISH analyses of samples collected from the Florida Keys quantified seasonal shifts in community composition as well as fluctuations in overall Gambierdiscus cell abundance. Application of species-specific FISH probes provides a powerful new tool to those seeking to target individual Gambierdiscus species, including significant toxin-producers, in field populations. Moving forward, analysis of Gambierdiscus community composition across multiple environments and over time will also allow species dynamics to be linked to environmental parameters, improving our ability to understand and manage the current and changing risks of CP worldwide.","[Pitz, Kathleen J.; Richlen, Mindy L.; Fachon, Evangeline; Anderson, Donald M.] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Biol Dept, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; [Smith, Tyler B.] Univ Virgin Isl, Ctr Marine & Environm Studies, St Thomas, VI 00802 USA; [Parsons, Michael L.] Florida Gulf Coast Univ, Coastal Watershed Inst, Ft Myers, FL 33965 USA","Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution; University of the Virgin Islands; State University System of Florida; Florida Gulf Coast University","Richlen, ML (corresponding author), Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Biol Dept, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.","mrichlen@whoi.edu","Smith, Tyler/ITU-0015-2023","Smith, Tyler/0000-0002-5256-6087","NOAA NOS (CiguaHAB program) [NA11NOS4780060, NA11NOS4780028, N1A17NOS4780181]; NSF PIRE (OISE) [1743802]; Greater Caribbean Center [NIH 1P01ES028949-01, NSF 1841811]; WHOI Ocean Ventures Fund","NOAA NOS (CiguaHAB program); NSF PIRE (OISE); Greater Caribbean Center; WHOI Ocean Ventures Fund","This work was supported by NOAA NOS (CiguaHAB program; NA11NOS4780060 and NA11NOS4780028; CiguaTOX program; N1A17NOS4780181), NSF PIRE (OISE Award #1743802), and the Greater Caribbean Center for Ciguatera Research (NIH 1P01ES028949-01 and NSF 1841811), and the WHOI Ocean Ventures Fund.

Dredging operations, beach nourishment, and other coastal construction activities can increase sedimentation and turbidity in nearby coral reef habitats and have the potential to negatively affect coral larval development and metamorphosis, reducing sexual reproduction success. In this study, we investigated the performance of larvae of the threatened Caribbean coral species Orbicella faveolata exposed to suspended sediments collected from a reef site in southeast Florida recently impacted by dredging (Port of Miami), and compared it to the performance of larvae exposed to sediments collected from the offshore, natal reef of the parent colonies. In a laboratory experiment, we tested whether low and high doses of each of these sediment types affected the survival, settlement, and respiration of coral larvae compared to a no-sediment control treatment. In addition, we analyzed the sediments used in the experiments with 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing to assess differences in the microbial communities present in the Port versus Reef sediments, and their potential impact on coral performance. Overall, only O. faveolata larvae exposed to the high-dose Port sediment treatment had significantly lower survival rates compared to the control treatment, suggesting an initial tolerance to elevated suspended sediments. However, significantly lower settlement rates were observed in both Port treatments (low- and high-dose) compared to the control treatment one week after exposure, suggesting strong latent effects. Sediments collected near the Port also contained different microbial communities than Reef sediments, and higher relative abundances of the bacteria Desulfobacterales, which has been associated with coral disease. We hypothesize that differences in microbial communities between the two sediments may be a contributing factor in explaining the observed differences in larval performance. Together, these results suggest that the settlement success and survival of O. faveolata larvae are more readily compromised by encountering port inlet sediments compared to reef sediments, with potentially important consequences for the recruitment success of this species in affected areas.","[Serrano, Xaymara M.; Rosales, Stephanie M.; Palacio-Castro, Ana M.] Univ Miami, Cooperat Inst Marine & Atmospher Studies, Rosenstiel Sch Marine Atmospher & Earth Sci, Miami, FL 33136 USA; [Serrano, Xaymara M.; Rosales, Stephanie M.; Palacio-Castro, Ana M.] NOAA, Atlantic Oceanog & Meteorol Lab, Miami, FL 33149 USA; [Miller, Margaret W.] SECORE Int, Miami, FL USA; [Williamson, Olivia M.; Baker, Andrew C.] Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine Atmospher & Earth Sci, Dept Marine Biol & Ecol, Miami, FL 33136 USA; [Gomez, Andrea] NOAA, Greater Atlantic Reg Fisheries Off, Gloucester, MA USA; [Serrano, Xaymara M.] Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Habitat Conservat Div, W Palm Beach, FL 33401 USA","University of Miami; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Atlantic Oceanographic & Meteorological Laboratory (AOML); University of Miami; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA","Serrano, XM (corresponding author), Univ Miami, Cooperat Inst Marine & Atmospher Studies, Rosenstiel Sch Marine Atmospher & Earth Sci, Miami, FL 33136 USA.;Serrano, XM (corresponding author), NOAA, Atlantic Oceanog & Meteorol Lab, Miami, FL 33149 USA.;Baker, AC (corresponding author), Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine Atmospher & Earth Sci, Dept Marine Biol & Ecol, Miami, FL 33136 USA.","xaymara.serrano@noaa.gov; abaker@earth.miami.edu","Palacio-Castro, Ana/AAI-9619-2020","Williamson, Olivia/0000-0002-1710-1671; Palacio-Castro, Ana M./0000-0002-0821-0286","MOTE; Florida's Department of Environmental Protection; Cooperative Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Studies (CIMAS); National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)","MOTE; Florida's Department of Environmental Protection; Cooperative Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Studies (CIMAS); National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA)","The authors thank C.

Information on the genetic stock structure of sablefish is vital for constructing management strategies that ensure the long-term viability of the species. Most previous genetic studies on sablefish have found panmixia throughout the majority of their range, but a recent study suggested that a population structure may exist. Here, we use low-coverage whole genome resequencing to investigate genetic structure in the northern end of the species' range (from Washington State, USA to the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands, AK, USA). Additionally, we reanalyzed an existing genomic dataset containing 2661 markers to test specific hypotheses about genetic structure by sex. Genome resequencing data from 119 individuals screened at 7 110 228 markers revealed no evidence of population structure, and reanalysis of the existing genomic dataset supported the same conclusion. Differentiation across the genome was largely driven by variation at two putative inversions located similar to 1 megabase apart, which did not display any signals of geographic differentiation. Our study further supports the conclusion of genetic panmixia in sablefish throughout its northern range.","[Timm, Laura E.; Larson, Wesley A.] Alaska Fisheries Sci Ctr, Genet Program, Auke Bay Labs, Juneau, AK 99801 USA; [Timm, Laura E.] Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Coll Fisheries & Ocean Sci, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA; [Jasonowicz, Andrew J.] Univ Washington, Sch Aquat & Fishery Sci, Box 355020, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Nichols, Krista M.] NOAA, Conservat Biol Div, Northwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Seattle, WA 98112 USA; [Timm, Laura E.] Auke Bay Labs, Genet Program, 17109 Point Lena Loop Rd, Juneau, AK 99801 USA; [Jasonowicz, Andrew J.] Int Pacific Halibut Commiss, 2320 West Commodore Way,Suite 300, Seattle, WA 98199 USA","National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of Alaska System; University of Alaska Fairbanks; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA","Timm, LE (corresponding author), Auke Bay Labs, Genet Program, 17109 Point Lena Loop Rd, Juneau, AK 99801 USA.","laura.timm@noaa.gov","","Timm, Laura E/0000-0002-7285-0261","Cooperative Institute for Climate, Ocean, and Ecosystem Studies (CICOES) under NOAA Cooperative Agreement [NA20OAR4320271, 2024-1365]","Cooperative Institute for Climate, Ocean, and Ecosystem Studies (CICOES) under NOAA Cooperative Agreement(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA)","This work is funded in part by the Cooperative Institute for Climate, Ocean, and Ecosystem Studies (CICOES) under NOAA Cooperative Agreement NA20OAR4320271, contribution no. 2024-1365.",NA,77,0,0,5,5,"OXFORD UNIV PRESS","OXFORD","GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","1054-3139","1095-9289","","ICES J MAR SCI","ICES J.

Interlude periods punctuated smaller more localized outbreaks in 2007, 2010, and 2017, although some fishes tested positive in the intervals. There have not been reports of outbreaks or positives from 2018, 2019, or 2020. Here, we employ a combined population genetics and phylogenetic approach to evaluate spatial and temporal evolutionary trajectory on itsG-gene sequence variation, in comparison with whole-genome sequences (11,083 bp) from a subset of 44 individual isolates (including 40 newly sequenced ones). Our results show that IVb (N = 184 individual fish isolates) diversified into 36G-gene haplotypes from 2003 to 2017, stemming from two originals (a and b).G-gene haplotypes a and b differed by just one synonymous single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) substitution, remained the most abundant until 2011, then disappeared. Group a descendants (14 haplotypes) remained most prevalent in the Upper and Central Great Lakes, with eight (51%) having nonsynonymous substitutions. Group b descendants primarily have occurred in the Lower Great Lakes, including 22 haplotypes, of which 15 (68%) contained nonsynonymous changes. Evolutionary patterns of the whole-genome sequences (which had 34 haplotypes among 44 isolates) appear congruent with those from theG-gene. Virus populations significantly diverged among the Upper, Central, and Lower Great Lakes, diversifying over time. Spatial divergence was apparent in the overall patterns of nucleotide substitutions, while amino acid changes increased temporally. VHSV-IVb thus significantly differentiated across its less than two decades in the Great Lakes, accompanied by declining outbreaks and virulence. Continuing diversification likely allowed the virus to persist at low levels in resident fish populations, and may facilitate its potential for further and future spread to new habitats and nonacclimated hosts.","[Stepien, Carol A.] NOAA, Genet & Genom Grp G3, Pacific Marine Environm Lab PMEL, 7600 Sand Point Way NE, Seattle, WA 98115 USA; [Niner, Megan D.] Univ Toledo, Dept Environm Sci, Genet & Genom Grp G3, 2801 W Bancroft St, Toledo, OH 43606 USA","National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University System of Ohio; University of Toledo","Stepien, CA (corresponding author), NOAA, Genet & Genom Grp G3, Pacific Marine Environm Lab PMEL, 7600 Sand Point Way NE, Seattle, WA 98115 USA.","carol.stepien@noaa.gov","Stepien, Carol/A-7898-2011","Stepien, Carol/0000-0002-5544-4333","National Science Foundation [NSF-DBI-1354806]; Agricultural Research Service [3655-31320-0000D]; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Agricultural Research Service(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)USDA Agricultural Research Service); National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA)","National Science Foundation, Grant/Award Number: NSF-DBI-1354806; Agricultural Research Service, Grant/Award Number: 3655-31320-0000D; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration",NA,139,5,5,0,3,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","2045-7758","","","ECOL EVOL","Ecol.

Given the commercial importance of this species, management is critical: in 1997, the southern Gulf of Mexico pink shrimp fishery was declared collapsed and mitigation strategies went into effect, with recovery efforts lasting over a decade. Fisheries management can be informed and improved through a better understanding of how factors associated with early life history impact genetic diversity and population structure in the recruited population. Farfantepenaeus duorarum are short-lived, but highly fecund, and display high variability in recruitment patterns. To date, modeling the impacts of ecological, physical, and behavioral factors on juvenile settlement has focused on recruitment of larval individuals of F. duorarum to nursery grounds in Florida Bay. Here, we articulate testable hypotheses stemming from a recent model of larval transport and evaluate support for each with a population genomics approach, generating reduced representation library sequencing data for F. duorarum collected from seven regions around the Florida Peninsula. Our research represents the first and most molecular data-rich study of population structure in F. duorarum in the Gulf and reveals evidence of a differentiated population in the Dry Tortugas. Our approach largely validates a model of larval transport, allowing us to make management-informative inferences about the impacts of spawning location and recruitment patterns on intraspecific genetic diversity. Such inferences improve our understanding of the roles of non-genetic factors in generating and maintaining genetic diversity in a commercially important penaeid shrimp species.","[Timm, Laura E.; Bracken-Grissom, Heather D.] Florida Int Univ, Dept Biol Sci, CRUSTOM Lab, Inst Environm, Miami, FL 33199 USA; [Timm, Laura E.] Univ Colorado, Computat Biosci Program, Aurora, CO 80045 USA; [Jackson, Thomas L.; Browder, Joan A.] NOAA, Southeast Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Miami, FL USA","State University System of Florida; Florida International University; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA","Timm, LE (corresponding author), Florida Int Univ, Dept Biol Sci, CRUSTOM Lab, Inst Environm, Miami, FL 33199 USA.;Timm, LE (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Computat Biosci Program, Aurora, CO 80045 USA.","ltimm004@fiu.edu","","Bracken-Grissom, Heather/0000-0002-4919-6679","Gulf of Mexico Research Initiative (GOMRI); NOAA RESTORE project; Colorado Biomedical Informatics Training Program [NIH T15 LM009451]","Gulf of Mexico Research Initiative (GOMRI); NOAA RESTORE project(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); Colorado Biomedical Informatics Training Program","This research was made possible by a grant from the Gulf of Mexico Research Initiative (GOMRI) and NOAA RESTORE project (to Bracken-Grissom), as well as the Colorado Biomedical Informatics Training Program (to Timm, NIH T15 LM009451).",NA,85,1,1,0,5,"FRONTIERS MEDIA SA","LAUSANNE","AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND","2296-701X","","","FRONT ECOL EVOL","Front.

Microcystis aeruginosa often dominates cyanoHABs and produces microcystin (MC), a class of hepatotoxins that poses threats to human and animal health. Microcystin toxicity is influenced by distinct structural elements across a diversity of related molecules encoded by variant mcy operons. However, the composition and distribution of mcy operon variants in natural blooms remain poorly understood. Here, we characterized the variant composition of mcy genes in western Lake Erie Microcystis blooms from 2014 and 2018. Sampling was conducted across several spatial and temporal scales, including different bloom phases within 2014, extensive spatial coverage on the same day (2018), and frequent, autonomous sampling over a 2-week period (2018). Mapping of metagenomic and metatranscriptomic sequences to reference sequences revealed three Microcystis mcy genotypes: complete (all genes present [mcyA-J]), partial (truncated mcyA, complete mcyBC, and missing mcyD-J), and absent (no mcy genes). We also detected two different variants of mcyB that may influence the production of microcystin congeners. The relative abundance of these genotypes was correlated with pH and nitrate concentrations. Metatranscriptomic analysis revealed that partial operons were, at times, the most abundant genotype and expressed in situ, suggesting the potential biosynthesis of truncated products. Quantification of genetic divergence between genotypes suggests that the observed strains are the result of preexisting heterogeneity rather than de novo mutation during the sampling period. Overall, our results show that natural Microcystis populations contain several cooccurring mcy genotypes that dynamically shift in abundance spatiotemporally via strain succession and likely influence the observed diversity of the produced congeners. IMPORTANCE Cyanobacteria are responsible for producing microcystins (MCs), a class of potent and structurally diverse toxins, in freshwater systems around the world. While microcystins have been studied for over 50 years, the diversity of their chemical forms and how this variation is encoded at the genetic level remain poorly understood, especially within natural populations of cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (cyanoHABs). Here, we leverage community DNA and RNA sequences to track shifts in mcy genes responsible for producing microcystin, uncovering the relative abundance, expression, and variation of these genes. We studied this phenomenon in western Lake Erie, which suffers annually from cyanoHAB events, with impacts on drinking water, recreation, tourism, and commercial fishing. Cyanobacteria are responsible for producing microcystins (MCs), a class of potent and structurally diverse toxins, in freshwater systems around the world. While microcystins have been studied for over 50 years, the diversity of their chemical forms and how this variation is encoded at the genetic level remain poorly understood, especially within natural populations of cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (cyanoHABs).","[Yancey, Colleen E.; Smith, Derek J.; Dick, Gregory J.] Univ Michigan, Earth & Environm Sci, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Den Uyl, Paul A.; Dick, Gregory J.] Univ Michigan, Cooperat Inst Great Lakes Res CIGLR, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Mohamed, Osama G.; Tripathi, Ashootosh] Univ Michigan, Life Sci Inst, Nat Prod Discovery Core, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Mohamed, Osama G.; Yu, Fengan; Tripathi, Ashootosh; Sherman, David H.] Univ Michigan, Life Sci Inst, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Mohamed, Osama G.] Cairo Univ, Fac Pharm, Pharmacognosy Dept, Cairo, Egypt; [Ruberg, Steven A.] NOAA, Great Lakes Environm Res Lab, 2205 Commonwealth Blvd, Ann Arbor, MI 48105 USA; [Chaffin, Justin D.] Ohio State Univ, FT Stone Lab, Put In Bay, OH USA; [Chaffin, Justin D.] Ohio State Univ, Ohio Sea Grant, Put In Bay, OH USA; [Goodwin, Kelly D.] NOAA, Ocean Chem & Ecosyst Div, Atlantic Oceanog & Meteorol Lab AOML, Miami, FL USA; [Goodwin, Kelly D.] NOAA, Southwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, La Jolla, CA USA; [Tripathi, Ashootosh; Sherman, David H.] Univ Michigan, Dept Med Chem, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Cairo University; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan","Dick, GJ (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Earth & Environm Sci, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.;Dick, GJ (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Cooperat Inst Great Lakes Res CIGLR, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.","gdick@umich.edu","Dick, Gregory/D-8901-2012; Mohamed, Osama/C-7995-2017; Goodwin, Kelly/B-4985-2014","Mohamed, Osama/0000-0003-3216-6948; Goodwin, Kelly/0000-0001-9583-8073; Smith, Derek/0000-0002-0895-5712; Chaffin, Justin/0000-0002-5372-4577; Yancey, Colleen/0000-0002-6078-9483","NIH [1P01ES028939-01]; NSF [OCE-1840715]; Cooperative Institute of Great Lakes Research [NA17OAR4320152]; NOAA ECOHAB award [NA17NOS4780186]; NOAA OAR Omics; NOAA OAR Ocean Technology Development Initiative; National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences [P01ES028939] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Cooperative Institute of Great Lakes Research; NOAA ECOHAB award(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); NOAA OAR Omics(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); NOAA OAR Ocean Technology Development Initiative(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS))","This work was supported by NIH and NSF awards to the Great Lakes Center for Fresh Waters and Human Health (NIH award 1P01ES028939-01 and NSF award OCE-1840715) and the Cooperative Institute of Great Lakes Research (NA17OAR4320152).

Accumulation of PS microplastics has been reported to affect innate immune cells and inflammatory responses in fish. To date, knowledge on effects of microplastics on the antibody response is still very limited. Here, we investigated effects of small (0.8-20 mu m) PS microplastics on the abundance of B lineage cells in primary cultures of developing immune cells from the anterior kidney of rainbow trout. Both purchased PS microbeads and PS microparticles generated from consumer products were used as microplastic sources. We first show that rainbow trout phagocytic B cells efficiently took up small (0.83-3.1 mu m) PS microbeads within hours of exposure. In addition, our data revealed that PS microplastic exposure most significantly decreased the abundance of a population of non-phagocytic developing B cells, using both flow cytometry and RT-qPCR. PS microplastics-induced loss of developing B cells further correlated with reduced gene expression of RAG1 and the membrane form of immunoglobulin heavy chains mu and tau. Based on the induced loss of developing B cells observed in our in vitro studies, we speculate that in vivo, chronic PS microplastic-exposure may lead to suboptimal IgM/IgT levels in response to pathogens in teleost species. Considering the highly conserved nature of vertebrate B lymphopoiesis it is likely that PS microplastics will similarly reduce antibody responses in higher vertebrate species, including humans. Further, RAG1 provides an effective biomarker to determine effects of PS microplastics on B cell development in teleost species.","[Zwollo, Patty; Quddos, Fatima; Abderhalden, Lauren] William & Mary, Dept Biol, Williamsburg, VA 23185 USA; [Bagdassarian, Carey] William & Mary, Interdisciplinary Studies, Williamsburg, VA 23185 USA; [Seeley, Meredith Evans; Hale, Robert C.] William & Mary, Dept Aquat Hlth Sci, Virginia Inst Marine Sci, Gloucester Point, VA 23062 USA","William & Mary; Virginia Institute of Marine Science","Zwollo, P (corresponding author), William & Mary, Dept Biol, Williamsburg, VA 23185 USA.","pxzwol@wm.edu","Hale, Robert/D-7601-2013","Quddos, Fatima/0000-0003-3866-5780; Seeley, Meredith Evans/0000-0003-0696-4559; Hale, Robert/0000-0002-3066-8891","NOAA-Marine Debris Program [NA19NOS9990085]; Freeman Family Foundation","NOAA-Marine Debris Program; Freeman Family Foundation","The authors wish to thank Mss.

Although bleaching events reveal fine-scale patterns of resilience, traits enabling persistence under global change remain elusive. We conducted a 95-d controlled-laboratory experiment investigating how duration of exposure to warming (similar to 28, 31 degrees C), acidification (pCO(2) similar to 343 [present day], similar to 663 [end of century], similar to 3109 [extreme] mu atm), and their combination influences physiology of reef-building corals (Siderastrea siderea, Pseudodiploria strigosa) from two reef zones on the Belize Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System. Every 30 d, net calcification rate, host protein and carbohydrate, chlorophyll a, and symbiont density were quantified for the same coral individual to characterize acclimation potential under global change. Coral physiologies of the two species were differentially affected by stressors and exposure duration was found to modulate these responses. Siderastrea siderea exhibited resistance to end of century pCO(2) and temperature stress, but calcification was negatively affected by extreme pCO(2). However, S. siderea calcification rates remained positive after 95 d of extreme pCO(2) conditions, suggesting acclimation. In contrast, P. strigosa was more negatively influenced by elevated temperatures, which reduced most physiological parameters. An exception was nearshore P. strigosa, which maintained calcification rates under elevated temperature, suggesting local adaptation to the warmer environment of their natal reef zone. This work highlights how tracking coral physiology across various exposure durations can capture acclimatory responses to global change stressors.","[Aichelman, Hannah E.; Bove, Colleen B.; Nieves, Olivia C.; Davies, Sarah W.] Boston Univ, Dept Biol, 5 Cummington St, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Aichelman, Hannah E.; Castillo, Karl D.; Boulton, Jessica M.; Knowlton, Alyssa C.; Davies, Sarah W.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Marine Sci, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA; [Bove, Colleen B.; Castillo, Karl D.] Univ N Carolina, Environm Ecol & Energy Program, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA; [Ries, Justin B.; Davies, Sarah W.] Northeastern Univ, Dept Marine & Environm Sci, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Boston University; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; Northeastern University","Aichelman, HE; Davies, SW (corresponding author), Boston Univ, Dept Biol, 5 Cummington St, Boston, MA 02215 USA.;Aichelman, HE; Davies, SW (corresponding author), Univ N Carolina, Dept Marine Sci, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA.;Davies, SW (corresponding author), Northeastern Univ, Dept Marine & Environm Sci, Boston, MA 02115 USA.","haich@bu.edu; daviessw@bu.edu","Bove, Colleen/AFQ-8778-2022; Davies, Sarah/ITT-3963-2023; Ries, Justin/B-8391-2017","Ries, Justin/0000-0001-8427-206X; Bove, Colleen B./0000-0003-0340-1371","NSF [OCE-1437371, OCE-1459522, 2016222953]; NOAA [NA13OAR4310186]; National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine Gulf Research Program Fellowship","NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NOAA(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine Gulf Research Program Fellowship","We thank the Belize Fisheries Department for coral collection permits.

The Inhibitor of Apoptosis (IAP) gene family of apoptosis regulators is expanded in molluscs, including eastern, Crassostrea virginica, and Pacific, Crassostrea gigas, oysters. The functional importance of IAP expansion in apoptosis and immunity in oysters remains unknown. Results Phylogenetic analysis of IAP genes in 10 molluscs identified lineage specific gene expansion in bivalve species. Greater IAP gene family expansion was observed in C. virginica than C. gigas (69 vs. 40), resulting mainly from tandem duplications. Functional domain analysis of oyster IAP proteins revealed 3 novel Baculoviral IAP Repeat (BIR) domain types and 14 domain architecture types across gene clusters, 4 of which are not present in model organisms. Phylogenetic analysis of bivalve IAPs suggests a complex history of domain loss and gain. Most IAP genes in oysters (76% of C. virginica and 82% of C. gigas), representing all domain architecture types, were expressed in response to immune challenge (Ostreid Herpesvirus OsHV-1, bacterial probionts Phaeobacter inhibens and Bacillus pumilus, several Vibrio spp., pathogenic Aliiroseovarius crassostreae, and protozoan parasite Perkinsus marinus). Patterns of IAP and apoptosis-related differential gene expression differed between the two oyster species, where C. virginica, in general, differentially expressed a unique set of IAP genes in each challenge, while C. gigas differentially expressed an overlapping set of IAP genes across challenges. Apoptosis gene expression patterns clustered mainly by resistance/susceptibility of the oyster host to immune challenge. Weighted Gene Correlation Network Analysis (WGCNA) revealed unique combinations of transcripts for 1 to 12 IAP domain architecture types, including novel types, were significantly co-expressed in response to immune challenge with transcripts in apoptosis-related pathways. Conclusions Unprecedented diversity characterized by novel BIR domains and protein domain architectures was observed in oyster IAPs. Complex patterns of gene expression of novel and conserved IAPs in response to a variety of ecologically-relevant immune challenges, combined with evidence of direct co-expression of IAP genes with apoptosis-related transcripts, suggests IAP expansion facilitates complex and nuanced regulation of apoptosis and other immune responses in oysters.","[Witkop, Erin M.; Gomez-Chiarri, Marta] Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Fisheries Anim & Vet Sci, Kingston, RI 02881 USA; [Proestou, Dina A.] USDA ARS NEA NCWMAC Shellfish Genet Program, Kingston, RI USA","University of Rhode Island","Gomez-Chiarri, M (corresponding author), Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Fisheries Anim & Vet Sci, Kingston, RI 02881 USA.","gomezchi@uri.edu","","Gomez-Chiarri, Marta/0000-0002-2576-9612; Witkop, Erin M/0000-0002-4117-7334","USDA NIFA AFRI Pre-Doctoral Fellowship Award [2019-67011-29553]; Department of Commerce/NOAA SaltonstallKennedy Award [NA18NMF4270193]; USDA NIFA AFRI Award [2015-67016-22942]; USDA ARS Collaborative Project [58-8030-5-009]; USDA NRSP-8 award; USDA NIFA [RI0019-H020]; URI Coastal Institute Grants in Aid; Blount Family Shellfish Restoration Foundation","USDA NIFA AFRI Pre-Doctoral Fellowship Award; Department of Commerce/NOAA SaltonstallKennedy Award; USDA NIFA AFRI Award; USDA ARS Collaborative Project; USDA NRSP-8 award; USDA NIFA(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)); URI Coastal Institute Grants in Aid; Blount Family Shellfish Restoration Foundation","This work was supported by a USDA NIFA AFRI Pre-Doctoral Fellowship Award # 2019-67011-29553 to EMW, Department of Commerce/NOAA SaltonstallKennedy Award #NA18NMF4270193 to MGC, David R.

A variety of measuring methodologies including size-fractionated chlorophyll (< 2, 2-20, and >20 mu m), phytoplankton groups by FluoroProbe, cyanobacterial genera by 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and particulate C, N, and P gave us different insights into seasonal phytoplankton dynamics and mussel selective feeding and assimilation. High clearance rates and/or high assimilation rates were seen during late May-early July across all size categories, with high rates seen particularly in cryptophytes and diatoms as revealed by FluoroProbe. Starting in late July cyanophytes dominated the phytoplankton and feeding rate on them was generally zero or low. Sequencing analyses suggested that there was a diverse cyanobacterial community present, with Microcystis, contrary to expectation, dominating only in late June. Cyanobium was the dominant genera at most times during summer-fall, and as expected, Microcystis was rejected by mussels relative to other cyanobacteria. Planktothrix, dominant in spring, was readily ingested as well as Anabaena in late June. We show that a combination of methods is helpful to make progress in understanding plankton succession and grazing. These methods were important adjuncts to microscopic analysis (Carrick et al, this issue). Our results support the hypothesis that dreissenid mussels, when abundant, can affect seasonal succession of phytoplankton shifting composition to cyanobacteria and even changes within the cyanobacterial community; however, impacts are likely modest now due low mussel biomass (Carter et al., this issue). Assimilation of C, N, and P was generally high, which is important for mussel population maintenance.","[Vanderploeg, H. A.; Glyshaw, P. W.; Fanslow, D.

A myriad of conservation threats has led to range-wide population declines, but population trends among islands can vary widely in response to heterogeneous threats. Populations in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands have been declining, whereas Main Hawaiian Islands numbers are expanding. Molecular data can provide information to disentangle population structure and dynamics; however, previous studies have yielded insufficient resolution in such a genetically depauperate species. Advances in genomic technology and affordability offer a novel opportunity to revisit questions about Hawaiian monk seal trends with high-resolution markers that provide better discrimination ability in low-diversity species. Here, we investigated region- and island-level population structuring and connectivity. We used BestRAD sequencing on 169 seals from 14 islands that span the archipelago to estimate genetic diversity, genetic differentiation, population structure, and migration rates. We did not find robust evidence for island-level population structure. For the first time, our data set provided resolution to differentiate regional populations with low but significant genetic differentiation. Further, DAPC illustrated population structure with evidence for connectivity, which mirrored our migration rate estimates. Future conservation decisions will need to consider the balance of maintaining connectivity between regions while not homogenizing and losing valuable, yet rare, regional unique variation.","[Hauser, Samantha; Latch, Emily] Univ Wisconsin Milwaukee, Dept Biol Sci, Milwaukee, WI 53211 USA; [Robinson, Stacie] NOAA, Pacific Isl Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, 1845 Wasp Blvd, Honolulu, HI 96818 USA; [Robinson, Stacie] Natl Wildlife Res Ctr, United State Dept Agr, 4101 LaPorte Ave, Ft Collins, CO 80525 USA","University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Milwaukee; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA","Hauser, S (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin Milwaukee, Dept Biol Sci, Milwaukee, WI 53211 USA.","samantha.hauser1@gmail.com","","","NOAA National Marine Fisheries Service [848-1335, 848-1695, 932-1905, 10137-07, 16632, 18786]; University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee College of Letters and Science","NOAA National Marine Fisheries Service(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee College of Letters and Science","Acknowledgements.

It also causes rapid and life-threatening sepsis and wound infections in humans. Of its many virulence factors, it is the V. vulnificus capsule, composed of capsular polysaccharide (CPS), that plays a critical role in evasion of the host innate immune system by conferring antiphagocytic ability and resistance to complement-mediated killing. CPS may also provoke a portion of the host inflammatory cytokine response to this bacterium. CPS production is biochemically and genetically diverse among strains of V. vulnificus, and the carbohydrate diversity of CPS is likely affected by horizontal gene transfer events that result in new combinations of biosynthetic genes. Phase variation between virulent encapsulated opaque colonial variants and attenuated translucent colonial variants, which have little or no CPS, is a common phenotype among strains of this species. One mechanism for generating acapsular variants likely involves homologous recombination between repeat sequences flanking the wzb phosphatase gene within the Group 1 CPS biosynthetic and transport operon. A considerable number of environmental, genetic, and regulatory factors have now been identified that affect CPS gene expression and CPS production in this pathogen.","[Pettis, Gregg S.; Mukerji, Aheli S.] Louisiana State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA","Louisiana State University System; Louisiana State University","Pettis, GS (corresponding author), Louisiana State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA.","gpettis@lsu.edu; amuker1@lsu.edu","","Pettis, Gregg/0000-0002-5468-8870","National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Office of Sea Grant, Department of Commerce [NA06OAR4170022, R/PMO-21]; Louisiana State University","National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Office of Sea Grant, Department of Commerce(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); Louisiana State University","Research described from the authors' lab was supported in part by the Louisiana Sea Grant College Program with funds (to G.S.P.) from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Office of Sea Grant, Department of Commerce, under grant no.

Functional gene studies that provide information regarding what those microbes might do are fewer, particularly for non-tropical corals. Using the GeoChip 5.0S microarray, we present a functional gene study of microbiomes from five species of cold-water corals collected from depths of 296-1567 m. These species included two octocorals, Acanthogorgia aspera and Acanthogorgia spissa, and three stony corals: Desmophyllum dianthus, Desmophyllum pertusum (formerly Lophelia pertusa), and Enallopsammia profunda. A total of 24,281 gene sequences (representing different microbial taxa) encoding for 383 functional gene families and representing 9 metabolic gene categories were identified. Gene categories included metabolism of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur, as well as virulence, organic remediation, metal homeostasis, secondary metabolism and phylogeny. We found that microbiomes from Acanthogorgia spp. were the most functionally distinct but also least diverse compared against those from stony corals. Desmophyllum spp. microbiomes were more similar to each other than to E. profunda. Of 383 total gene families detected in this study, less than 20% were significantly different among these deep-water coral species. Similarly, out of 59 metabolic sub-categories for which we were able to make a direct comparison to microbiomes of tropical corals, only 7 were notably different: anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox), chitin degradation, and dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) degradation, all of which had higher representations in deep-water corals; and chromium homeostasis/resistance, copper homeostasis/resistance, antibiotic resistance, and methanogenesis, all of which had higher representation in tropical corals. This implies a broad-scale convergence of the microbial functional genes present within the coral holobiont, independent of coral species, depth, symbiont status, and morphology.","[Pratte, Zoe A.

Due to limitations in our ability to culture many benthic microorganisms under laboratory conditions, their potential to produce bioactive compounds remains under-explored. However, the advent of modern mass spectrometry technologies and data analysis methods for chemical structure prediction has aided in the discovery of such metabolites from complex mixtures. In this study, ocean sediments were col-lected from Baffin Bay (Canadian Arctic) and the Gulf of Maine for untargeted metabolomics using mass spectrometry. A direct examination of prepared organic extracts identified 1468 spectra, of which similar to 45% could be annotated using in silico analysis methods. A comparable number of spectral features were detected in sediments collected from both locations, but 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed a significantly more diverse bacterial community in samples from Baffin Bay. Based on spectral abundance, 12 specialized metabolites known to be associated with bacteria were selected for discussion. The application of metabolomics directly on marine sediments provides an avenue for culture-independent detection of metabolites produced under natural settings. The strategy can help prioritize samples for novel bioactive metabolite discovery using traditional workflows.","[Shaikh, Arshad Ali; Verhoeven, Joost T.

In toxigenic prey, a defence fitness cost should result in a trade-off between defence expression and individual growth. Yet, previous experimental work has failed to detect such induced defence cost in toxigenic phytoplankton. We measured a potential direct fitness cost of grazer-induced toxin production in a red tide dinoflagellate prey using relative gene expression (RGE) of a mitotic cyclin gene (cyc), a marker that correlates to cell growth. This approach disentangles the reduction in cell growth from the defence cost from the mortality by consumers. Treatments where the dinoflagellate Alexandrium catenella were exposed to copepod grazers significantly increased toxin production while decreasing RGE of cyc, indicating a defence-growth trade-off. The defence fitness cost represents a mean decrease of the cell growth rate of 32%. Simultaneously, we estimate that the traditional method to measure mortality loss by consumers is overestimated by 29%. The defence appears adaptive as the prey population persists in quasi steady state after the defence is induced. Our approach provides a novel framework to incorporate the fitness cost of defence in toxigenic prey-consumer interaction models.","[Park, Gihong; Dam, Hans G.] Univ Connecticut, Dept Marine Sci, 1080 Shennecossett Rd, Groton, CT 06340 USA","University of Connecticut","Dam, HG (corresponding author), Univ Connecticut, Dept Marine Sci, 1080 Shennecossett Rd, Groton, CT 06340 USA.","hans.dam@uconn.edu","Dam, Hans/A-9723-2015","Park, Gihong/0000-0002-7775-6063","US National Science Foundation; NSF [OCE-1130284]; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science Competitive Research Program [NA18NOS4780173]","US National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science Competitive Research Program(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA)","Research supported by the US National Science Foundation (grant no.

Amplicon sequencing of barcode genes, such as the 18S small subunit ribosomal RNA gene (henceforth, 18S gene), is a cost-effective and widely used genetic method for assessing the composition of marine protist communities. This method is now being applied from local to global scales to interrogate the causes and consequences of protist community variations. Significant efforts have been made to validate amplicon methods targeting prokaryotes, but the precision, accuracy, and quantitative potential of 18S gene amplicon sequencing methods for marine protists remain unclear. Here, we use artificial (mock) communities and environmental samples collected from the Santa Barbara Channel, CA to evaluate the precision and accuracy in an amplicon workflow targeting the V9 hypervariable region of the 18S gene for marine protists. Overall, we find that this amplicon workflow has high precision and reasonable accuracy, but the magnitude of analytical uncertainty can increase significantly unless certain procedural issues are avoided. Finally, we demonstrate the value of positive and negative controls in, and the quantitative potential of, amplicon sequencing assessments of marine protist communities.","[Catlett, Dylan; Siegel, David A.] UC Santa Barbara, Earth Res Inst, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Matson, Paul G.; Carlson, Craig A.; Wilbanks, Elizabeth G.; Iglesias-Rodriguez, M.

Crosstalk between ammonium and polyamines through their metabolic pathways has been demonstrated in plants and animals, while no research has been directed to explore this relationship in algae or to investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms. Previous research demonstrated that high concentrations of ammonium and putrescine were among the active substances in bacteria-derived algicide targeting dinoflagellates, suggesting that the biochemical inter-connection and/or interaction of these nitrogen compounds play an essential role in controlling these ecologically important algal species. In this research, putrescine, ammonium, or a combination of putrescine and ammonium was added to cultures of three dinoflagellate species to explore their effects. The results demonstrated the dose-dependent and species-specific synergistic effects of putrescine and ammonium on these species. To further explore the molecular mechanisms behind the synergistic effects, transcriptome analysis was conducted on dinoflagellate Karlodinium veneficum treated with putrescine or ammonium vs. a combination of putrescine and ammonium. The results suggested that the synergistic effects of putrescine and ammonium disrupted polyamine homeostasis and reduced ammonium tolerance, which may have contributed to the cell death of K. veneficum. There was also transcriptomic evidence of damage to chloroplasts and impaired photosynthesis of K. veneficum. This research illustrates the molecular mechanisms underlying the synergistic effects of the major nitrogen metabolites, ammonium and putrescine, in dinoflagellates and provides direction for future studies on polyamine biology in algal species.","[Wang, Yanfei; Coyne, Kathryn J.; Tarakhovskaya, Elena R.] Univ Delaware, Coll Earth Ocean & Environm, Lewes, DE 19958 USA","University of Delaware","Coyne, KJ (corresponding author), Univ Delaware, Coll Earth Ocean & Environm, Lewes, DE 19958 USA.","yfwang@udel.edu; kcoyne@udel.edu","Wang, Yanfei/H-9576-2015","Coyne, Kathryn/0000-0001-8846-531X; Wang, Yanfei/0000-0002-4919-3945","National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association (NOAA) National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science (NCCOS) Prevention","National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association (NOAA) National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science (NCCOS) Prevention","We would like to thank Chris R.

Regulatory and management efforts to enhance nutrient export from coastal ecosystems include sustainable oyster aquaculture that removes nitrogen in the form of oyster biomass and increases particulate export to underlying sediments where increased organic material may enhance microbial denitrification. To better understand the impacts of oyster aquaculture on nitrogen removal, we examined bacterial processes in sediments underlying three of the most common aquaculture methods that vary in the proximity of oysters to the sediments. Sediment samples underlying sites managed with these different aquaculture methods were examined using the 16S rRNA gene to assess microbial community structure, gene expression analyses to examine nitrogen and sulfur cycling genes, and nitrogen gas flux measurements. All sites were located in the same hydrodynamic setting within Waquoit Bay, MA during 2018 and 2019. Although sediments under the different oyster farming practices showed similar communities, ordination analysis revealed discrete community groups formed along the sampling season. Measured N2 fluxes and expression of key genes involved in denitrification, anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox), and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) increased during mid-summer and into fall in both years primarily under bottom cages. While all three oyster growing methods enhanced nitrogen removal relative to the control site, gene expression data indicate that the nitrogen retaining process of DNRA is particularly enhanced after end of July under bottom cages, and to a lesser extent, under suspended and floating bags. The choice of gear can also potentially increase processes that induce nitrogen retention in the form of ammonia in the underlying sediments over time, thus causing deviations from predicted nitrogen removal. If nitrogen removal is a primary objective, monitoring for these shifts is essential for making decisions about siting and size of aquaculture sites from year to year.","[Mara, Paraskevi; Edgcomb, Virginia P.; Beaudoin, David; Cox, Rebecca; Lott, Sarah] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Geol & Geophys, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; [Sehein, Taylor R.] MIT WHOI Joint Program Biol Oceanog, Cambridge, MA USA; [Sehein, Taylor R.] MIT WHOI Joint Program Biol Oceanog, Woods Hole, MA USA; [Martinsen, Chuck; Lovely, Christina] Marine & Environm Serv, Falmouth, MA USA; [Belcher, Bridget; Curran, Meghan; Farnan, Claire; Giannini, Peter; Paquette, Kyle; Pinckney, Anna; Schafer, Natalie; Rogers, Daniel R.] Stonehill Coll, Dept Chem, Lab Biogeochem, Easton, MA 02357 USA; [Surgeon-Rogers, Tonna-Marie] Waquoit Bay Natl Estuarine Res Reserve, Waquoit, MA USA","Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution","Rogers, DR (corresponding author), Stonehill Coll, Dept Chem, Lab Biogeochem, Easton, MA 02357 USA.","drogers2@stonehill.edu","Sehein, Taylor/HJI-8995-2023; Edgcomb, Virginia/Q-2434-2019; Rogers, Daniel/A-4904-2012","Rogers, Daniel/0000-0002-9515-8956; Mara, Paraskevi/0000-0003-0072-0238","National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration; National Estuarine Research Reserve System Science Collaborative [NAI4NOS4190145, 3004686666]","National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); National Estuarine Research Reserve System Science Collaborative","This work was supported by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and National Estuarine Research Reserve System Science Collaborative, award NAI4NOS4190145 (subaward 3004686666) to DR and VE.",NA,96,6,7,2,28,"FRONTIERS MEDIA SA","LAUSANNE","AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND","","2296-7745","","FRONT MAR SCI","Front.

In north-temperate lakes cyanobacteria appear in early summer, succeeding green algae as the dominant phytoplankton group, a pattern thought to be mediated by changes in temperature and bioavailable nutrients. To understand additional drivers of this successional pattern our study used reciprocal invasion experiments to examine the competitive interaction between Microcystis aeruginosa, a dominant contributor to cyanoHABs, and the green alga Chlorella sorokiniana. We considered two factors that may impact these interactions: (1) strain variation, with a specific emphasis on the presence or absence of the gene for the hepatotoxin microcystin, and (2) host-associated bacteria. We used toxic M. aeruginosa PCC 7806 (microcystin producing strain), a non-toxic mutant of PCC 7806, non-toxic M. aeruginosa PCC 9701 (non-microcystin producing strain), and C. sorokiniana. Each organism was available free of all bacteria (i.e., axenic) and with a re-introduced defined bacterial community to generate their xenic counterparts. Competitive interactions were assessed with reciprocal invasion experiments between paired xenic and paired axenic populations of C. sorokiniana and one of the two Microcystis strains, each assessed separately. Flow cytometry and random forest models were used to rapidly discriminate and quantify phytoplankton population densities with 99% accuracy. We found that M. aeruginosa PCC 7806, but not strain PCC 9701, could proliferate from low abundance in a steady-state population of C. sorokiniana. Further, the presence of bacteria allowed M. aeruginosa PCC 7806 to grow to a higher population density into an established C. sorokiniana population than when grown axenic. Conversely, when M. aeruginosa was dominant, C. sorokiniana was only able to proliferate from low density into the PCC 9701 strain, and only when axenic. The mutant of PCC 7806 lacking the ability to produce microcystin behaved similarly to the toxic wild-type, implying microcystin is not responsible for the difference in competitive abilities observed between the two wild-type strains. Quantification of microcystins (MCs) when PCC 7806 M. aeruginosa was introduced into the C. sorokiniana culture showed two-fold more MCs per cell when host associated bacteria were absent compared to present in both species cultures. Our results show that the ability of M. aeruginosa to compete with C. sorokiniana is determined by genomic differences beyond genes involved in microcystin toxin generation and indicate an important role of host-associated bacteria in mediating phytoplankton interspecies interactions. These results expand our understanding of the key drivers of phytoplankton succession and the establishment and persistence of freshwater harmful cyanobacterial blooms.","[Schmidt, Kathryn C.; Jackrel, Sara L.; Dick, Gregory J.; Denef, Vincent J.] Univ Michigan, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Smith, Derek J.; Dick, Gregory J.] Univ Michigan, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan","Denef, VJ (corresponding author), 4060 Biol Sci Bldg,1105 North Univ Ave, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.","vdenef@umich.edu","Dick, Gregory/D-8901-2012","Schmidt, Kathryn/0000-0002-8082-5218; Smith, Derek/0000-0002-0895-5712; Jackrel, Sara/0000-0001-7326-4996","UM M-Cubed Scholars program; NOAA Great Lakes Omics program through the UM Cooperative Institute for Great Lakes Research [NA17OAR4320152]; NSF [OCE-1736629]","UM M-Cubed Scholars program; NOAA Great Lakes Omics program through the UM Cooperative Institute for Great Lakes Research(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF))","We thank Lang Delancey and McKenzie Powers for help with phytoplankton culture growth.

Herring embryos are also highly susceptible to toxicity from chemicals leaching from oil stranded in intertidal and subtidal zones. The water-soluble components of crude oil trigger an adverse outcome pathway that involves disruption of the physiological functions of cardiomyocytes in the embryonic herring heart. In previous studies, impaired ionoregulation (calcium and potassium cycling) in response to specific polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) corresponds to lethal embryolarval heart failure or subtle chamber malformations at the high and low ends of the PAH exposure range, respectively. Sublethal cardiotoxicity, which involves an abnormal outgrowth (ballooning) of the cardiac ventricular chamber soon after hatching, subsequently compromises juvenile heart structure and function, leading to pathological hypertrophy of the ventricle and reduced individual fitness, measured as cardiorespiratory performance. Previous studies have not established a threshold for these sublethal and delayed-in-time effects, even with total (& sum;)PAH exposures as low as 29 ng/g of wet weight (tissue dose). Here, we extend these earlier findings showing that (1) cyp1a gene expression provides an oil exposure metric that is more sensitive than typical quantitation of PAHs via GC-MS and (2) heart morphometrics in herring embryos provide a similarly sensitive measure of toxic response. Early life stage injury to herring (impaired heart development) thus occurs below the quantitation limits for PAHs in both water and embryonic tissues as a conventional basis for assessing oil-induced losses to coastal marine ecosystems.","[Incardona, John P.; Linbo, Tiffany L.; French, Barbara L.; Bolton, Jennie L.; Scholz, Nathaniel L.] NOAA, Northwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Seattle, WA 98112 USA; [Cameron, James R.] NOAA, Saltwater Inc, Northwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Seattle, WA 98112 USA; [Gregg, Jacob L.; Hershberger, Paul K.] US Geol Survey, Marrowstone Marine Field Stn, Western Fisheries Res Ctr, Nordland, WA 98358 USA; [Donald, Carey E.] Inst Marine Res, N-5817 Bergen, Norway","National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; Institute of Marine Research - Norway","Incardona, JP (corresponding author), NOAA, Northwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Seattle, WA 98112 USA.","john.incardona@noaa.gov","Scholz, Nathaniel/L-1642-2013","Scholz, Nathaniel/0000-0001-6207-0272; French, Barbara/0000-0002-2358-9044; Cameron, James/0000-0001-6180-6049","NOAA National Ocean Service Office of Response and Restoration; Prince William Sound Regional Citizens Advisory Council; Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Trustee Council; Research Council of Norway [267820]","NOAA National Ocean Service Office of Response and Restoration(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); Prince William Sound Regional Citizens Advisory Council; Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Trustee Council(Exxon Mobil Corporation); Research Council of Norway(Research Council of Norway)","This research was funded in part by the NOAA National Ocean Service Office of Response and Restoration, the Prince William Sound Regional Citizens Advisory Council, the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Trustee Council, and the Research Council of Norway (Project #267820, EGGTOX).",NA,53,1,1,4,15,"AMER CHEMICAL SOC","WASHINGTON","1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","0013-936X","1520-5851","","ENVIRON SCI TECHNOL","Environ.

It is unclear if corals surviving in such conditions have adapted to withstand sedimentation, pollutants, and other environmental stressors. Lobe coral populations from Maunalua Bay, Hawaii showed clear genetic differentiation between the 'polluted, high-stress' nearshore site and the 'less polluted, lower-stress' offshore site. To understand the driving force of the observed genetic partitioning, reciprocal transplant and common-garden experiments were conducted to assess phenotypic differences between these two populations. Physiological responses differed significantly between the populations, revealing more stress-resilient traits in the nearshore corals. Changes in protein profiles highlighted the inherent differences in the cellular metabolic processes and activities between the two; nearshore corals did not significantly alter their proteome between the sites, while offshore corals responded to nearshore transplantation with increased abundances of proteins associated with detoxification, antioxidant defense, and regulation of cellular metabolic processes. The response differences across multiple phenotypes between the populations suggest local adaptation of nearshore corals to reduced water quality. Our results provide insight into coral's adaptive potential and its underlying processes, and reveal potential protein biomarkers that could be used to predict resiliency.","[Tisthammer, Kaho H.; Seneca, Francois O.; Richmond, Robert H.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Kewalo Marine Lab, 41 Ahui St, Honolulu, HI 96813 USA; [Timmins-Schiffman, Emma; Nunn, Brook L.] Univ Washington, Dept Genome Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Tisthammer, Kaho H.] San Francisco State Univ, Dept Biol, 1600 Holloway Ave, San Francisco, CA 94132 USA; [Seneca, Francois O.] Ctr Sci Monaco, 8,Quai Antoine 1er,2ieme Etage, MC-98000 Monaco, Monaco","University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; California State University System; San Francisco State University","Tisthammer, KH (corresponding author), Univ Hawaii Manoa, Kewalo Marine Lab, 41 Ahui St, Honolulu, HI 96813 USA.;Nunn, BL (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Dept Genome Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.;Tisthammer, KH (corresponding author), San Francisco State Univ, Dept Biol, 1600 Holloway Ave, San Francisco, CA 94132 USA.","kahot@hawaii.edu; brookh@uw.edu","Richmond, Robert/G-1385-2014; Seneca, Francois/F-9040-2010","Tisthammer, Kaho/0000-0002-4530-4572","National Fish and Wildlife Foundation [34413]; Hawaii Department of Health [MOA 13-502]; NOAA Coral Reef Conservation Program; NOAA Coral Reef Ecosystem Studies Program [NA09NOS4780178]; NOAA/NMFS Pacific Islands Regional Office; University of Washington's Proteomics Resource [UWPR95794]","National Fish and Wildlife Foundation; Hawaii Department of Health; NOAA Coral Reef Conservation Program(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); NOAA Coral Reef Ecosystem Studies Program(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); NOAA/NMFS Pacific Islands Regional Office; University of Washington's Proteomics Resource","We thank V.

The relocation of otherwise doomed clutches to safe hatcheries has been widely promoted as a conservation strategy, although this may promote artificial selection of poorly adapted genotypes. In this study, we used multiyear spatial nesting data of individual loggerhead turtles (Caretta caretta) from one of the largest Atlantic rookeries, in Cabo Verde, across six consecutive nesting seasons (2013-2018), to identify spatial nesting patterns, assess how individual nest site selection is influenced by female size and age, and estimate the impacts on the reproductive output. Although females nested across the entire beach width, they preferentially nested in the middle of the beach, avoiding to nest both close to the tideline and close to the vegetation line. Hatching success decreased towards the waterline, while the risk of nest inundation or predation was high, regardless of nest location. In general, females showed high variability in nest site selection, except larger females (> 93 cm curved carapace length) that showed higher repeatability (r = 0.50, SE = 0.14, 95% CI: 0.16-0.72) in distances to the vegetation. We therefore suggest that the relocation of doomed clutches should be considered for this endangered rookery, as clutch relocation should not substantially distort the gene pool, assuming nest choice is a heritable trait. In addition, we recommend the preservation of beach vegetation, particularly in areas with human development.","[Martins, Samir; Loureiro, Nuno de Santos] Univ Algarve, Fac Sci & Technol, Campus Gambelas, P-8005139 Faro, Portugal; [Martins, Samir; Marco, Adolfo] BIOS CV Environm Conservat & Sustainable Dev, Sal Rei 5211, Cape Verde; [Patricio, Rita] ISPA, Mare Marine & Environm Sci Ctr, Lisbon, Portugal; [Patricio, Rita] Univ Exeter, Coll Life & Environm Sci, Ctr Ecol & Conservat, Cornwall Campus, Penryn, Portugal; [Clarke, Leo J.] Bangor Univ, Sch Ocean Sci, Menai Bridge, Gwynedd, Wales; [Marco, Adolfo] CSIC, Dept Conservat Biodivers, Estn Biol Donana, C Americo Vespucio S-N, Seville 41092, Spain","Universidade do Algarve; Instituto Superior Psicologia Aplicada (ISPA); Bangor University; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Estacion Biologica de Donana (EBD)","Martins, S (corresponding author), Cp 5211, Sal Rei Boa Vista Isl, Cape Verde.","ilheuraso@gmail.com","Patricio, Rita/AAE-2655-2021; Martins, Samir/JEF-1397-2023; Clarke, Leo/JNR-2866-2023; Marco, Adolfo/B-7118-2009; Patricio, Ana Rita/B-3437-2019","Marco, Adolfo/0000-0002-6523-9704; Patricio, Ana Rita/0000-0003-4963-2343; Martins, Samir/0000-0003-3156-9630","Hotel Riu Tuareg (Boa Vista); Marine Turtle Conservation Fund (MTCF) - US Fisheries and Wildlife Service/NOAA [F12AS00404]; Mava Foundation for Nature [AO1 [17105]]","Hotel Riu Tuareg (Boa Vista); Marine Turtle Conservation Fund (MTCF) - US Fisheries and Wildlife Service/NOAA(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); Mava Foundation for Nature","This research was funded by a Hotel Riu Tuareg (Boa Vista) , Marine Turtle Conservation Fund (MTCF) - US Fisheries and Wildlife Service/NOAA (Grant #F12AS00404) and the Mava Foundation for Nature (Grant #AO1 [17105] ) .",NA,54,4,4,1,8,"ELSEVIER","AMSTERDAM","RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","0022-0981","1879-1697","","J EXP MAR BIOL ECOL","J.

Biological variation among taxa within the genus is apparent through genetic and phenotypic differences between strains and via the spatial and temporal distribution of strains in the environment, and this fine-scale diversity exerts strong influence over bloom toxicity. Yet we do not know how varying traits of Microcystis strains govern their environmental distribution, the tradeoffs and links between these traits, or how they are encoded at the genomic level. Here we synthesize current knowledge on the importance of diversity within Microcystis and on the genes and traits that likely underpin ecological differentiation of taxa. We briefly review spatial and environmental patterns of Microcystis diversity in the field and genetic evidence for cohesive groups within Microcystis. We then compile data on strain-level diversity regarding growth responses to environmental conditions and explore evidence for variation of community interactions across Microcystis strains. Potential links and tradeoffs between traits are identified and discussed. The resulting picture, while incomplete, highlights key knowledge gaps that need to be filled to enable new models for predicting strain-level dynamics, which influence the development, toxicity and cosmopolitan nature of Microcystis blooms.","[Dick, Gregory J.; Kharbush, Jenan J.; Nitschky, Helena S.; Powers, McKenzie A.; Smith, Derek J.; Yancey, Colleen E.; Zwiers, Claire C.] Univ Michigan, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Dick, Gregory J.; Duhaime, Melissa B.; Evans, Jacob T.; Schmidt, Kathryn C.; Denef, Vincent J.] Univ Michigan, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Errera, Reagan M.; Vanderploeg, Henry A.] NOAA, Great Lakes Environm Res Lab, 2205 Commonwealth Blvd, Ann Arbor, MI 48105 USA; [Godwin, Casey M.] Univ Michigan, Cooperat Inst Great Lakes Res, Sch Environm & Sustainabil, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Powers, McKenzie A.] Univ Georgia, Dept Marine Sci, Athens, GA 30602 USA","University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University System of Georgia; University of Georgia","Dick, GJ (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.;Dick, GJ; Denef, VJ (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.","gdick@umich.edu; vdenef@umich.edu","Kharbush, Jenan/ABE-6132-2020; Godwin, Casey/JVZ-2099-2024; Dick, Gregory/D-8901-2012; Godwin, Casey/E-6892-2014","Nitschky, Helena/0000-0001-5802-1259; Yancey, Colleen/0000-0002-6078-9483; Kharbush, Jenan/0000-0002-9963-098X; Dick, Gregory/0000-0001-7666-6288; Cook, Claire/0000-0003-0235-4091; Godwin, Casey/0000-0002-4454-7521","NSF [OCE-1736629]; NOAA Great Lakes Omics program through the UM Cooperative Institute for Great Lakes Research [NA17OAR4320152]; NOAA Great Lakes Omics program through the NOAA Cooperative Agreement; Cooperative Institute for Great Lakes Research (CIGLR) at the University of Michigan [NA17OAR4320152]; Michigan Sea Grant College Program [R/WQ-8, NA18OAR4170102]; NOAA National Sea Grant, U.S. Department of Commerce; State of Michigan; NERC [NE/R017050/1] Funding Source: UKRI","NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NOAA Great Lakes Omics program through the UM Cooperative Institute for Great Lakes Research(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); NOAA Great Lakes Omics program through the NOAA Cooperative Agreement(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); Cooperative Institute for Great Lakes Research (CIGLR) at the University of Michigan; Michigan Sea Grant College Program; NOAA National Sea Grant, U.S. Department of Commerce(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); State of Michigan; NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC))","This work was supported by funding from NSF (OCE-1736629 to G.J.D.) and from the NOAA Great Lakes Omics program distributed through the UM Cooperative Institute for Great Lakes Research (NA17OAR4320152 to V.J.D., M.B.D. and G.J.D.) and through the NOAA Cooperative Agreement with the Cooperative Institute for Great Lakes Research (CIGLR) at the University of Michigan (NA17OAR4320152).

Six specimens were collected at a depth range of 81-93 m from Papahlinaumokuakea Marine National Monument, and their morphology investigated, as well as molecular phylogenetic analyses of the plastidial ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase large-subunit (rbcL) gene and a concatenated alignment of rbcL and nuclear large-subunit rRNA gene (ISIJ) sequences. Phylogenetic analyses supported H. hawaiiense sp. nov. as a distinct lineage within the genus Haraldiophyllum, and sister to a large Glade containing the type species, H. bonnemaisonii, as well as H. crispatum and an undescribed European specimen. The six Hawaiian specimens we re shown to be identical, but unique among other species of the genus as well as the recently segregated genus Neoharaldiophyllum, which comprises half of the species previously included in Haraldiophyllum. The vegetative morphology of H. hawaiiense sp. nov. resembles Neoharaldiophyllum udoense (formerly H. udoensis); however, no female or post-fertilization structures were found in the Hawaiian specimens to allow a more comprehensive comparison. The molecular phylogenies demonstrate that Haraldiophyllum is paraphyletic, suggesting either that the Myriogrammeae tribe includes undescribed genera, including Haraldiophyllu in senstt stricto, or that Neoharaldiophyllum species should be transferred into the genus Haraldiophyllum. However, based on vegetative morphology and molecular analyses, and pending resolution of this taxonomic issue, the Hawaiian specimens are placed within the genus Haraldiophyllum. This new record for the Hawaiian Islands highlights the novel biodiversity from mesophotic depths, reaffirming the need for further investigation into the biodiversity of Mesophotic Coral Ecosystems.","[Paiano, Monica O.; Cabrera, Feresa P.; Spalding, Heather L.; Sherwood, Alison R.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Sch Life Sci, 3190 Maile Way, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Huisman, John M.] Western Australian Herbarium Biodivers & Conserva, Dept Biodivers Conservat & Attract, Locked Bag 104, Bentley Delivery Centre, WA 6983, Australia; [Spalding, Heather L.] Coll Charleston, Dept Biol, 66 George St, Charleston, SC 29424 USA; [Kosaki, Randall K.] NOAA, Papaluinaumokuakea Marine Natl Monument, 1845 Wasp Blvd,Bldg 176, Honolulu, HI 96818 USA","University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; College of Charleston; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA","Paiano, MO (corresponding author), Univ Hawaii Manoa, Sch Life Sci, 3190 Maile Way, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.","mpaiano@hawaii.edu","Paiano, Monica/HMD-3368-2023","Cabrera, Feresa Corazon/0000-0002-3884-3631; Paiano, Monica/0000-0001-9200-3433","U.S. National Science Foundation [DEB-1754117]; U.S. National Fish & Wildlife Foundation [NFWF 0810.18.059023]; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument","U.S. National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); U.S. National Fish & Wildlife Foundation; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument","We thank the talented divers associated with the Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument, and the officers and crew of the NOAA ship Hiialakai for access to the Hawaiian MCEs.

The latter can enhance survival of individual organisms during short periods of extreme environmental perturbations, allowing genetic adaptation to take place over generations. Along the U.S. East Coast, estuarine-dependent spotted seatrout (Cynoscion nebulosus) populations span a steep temperature gradient that provides an ideal opportunity to explore the molecular basis of phenotypic plasticity. Genetically distinct spotted seatrout sampled from a northern and a southern population were exposed to acute cold and heat stress (5 biological replicates in each treatment and control group), and their transcriptomic responses were compared using RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq). The southern population showed a larger transcriptomic response to acute cold stress, whereas the northern population showed a larger transcriptomic response to acute heat stress compared with their respective population controls. Shared transcripts showing significant differences in expression levels were predominantly enriched in pathways that included metabolism, transcriptional regulation, and immune response. In response to heat stress, only the northern population significantly upregulated genes in the apoptosis pathway, which could suggest greater vulnerability to future heat waves in this population as compared to the southern population. Genes showing population-specific patterns of expression, including hpt, acot, hspa5, and hsc71, are candidates for future studies aiming to monitor intraspecific differences in temperature stress responses in spotted seatrout. Our findings contribute to the current understanding of phenotypic plasticity and provide a basis for predicting the response of a eurythermal fish species to future extreme temperatures.","[Song, Jingwei; McDowell, Jan R.] Virginia Inst Marine Sci VIMS, Coll William & Mary, Gloucester Point, VA 23062 USA","William & Mary","McDowell, JR (corresponding author), Virginia Inst Marine Sci VIMS, Coll William & Mary, Gloucester Point, VA 23062 USA.","mcdowell@vims.edu","","Song, Jingwei/0000-0003-3151-543X; McDowell, Jan/0000-0002-4849-0649","Virginia Sea Grant (NOAA Sea Grant Omnibus award) [NA140AR4170093]; International Women's Fishing Association Scholarship Trust","Virginia Sea Grant (NOAA Sea Grant Omnibus award); International Women's Fishing Association Scholarship Trust","We would like to thank Steve Arnott, Tim O'Donnell, and John Archambault from South Carolina Department of Natural Resources for acquiring spotted seatrout from the southern population; and Sheldon Arey, Patrick McGrath, and Joseph Matt for acquiring fish from the northern population.

These pairs are ideal for comparative studies to understand how life-history traits, historical events, and environment interact to produce population genetic structure. Black rockfish, Sebastes melanops, forms one such pair. Its sister species, yellowtail rockfish (Sebastes flavidus), shows a genetic cline likely influenced by a dispersal barrier at Cape Mendocino, CA and northward range expansion. Due to geographic overlap and close systematic relationship, we predicted black rockfish was influenced by similar evolutionary processes and thus would show genetic pattern concordance with yellowtail rockfish. We analyzed similar to 1000 black rockfish from 22 sites spanning the species' range to test the null hypothesis of no structure, using the same markers that characterized yellowtail rockfish (i.e., 812 bp of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene and six microsatellite loci). We reject the null hypothesis based on existence of at least three populations and microsatellite genetic divergence that separates the Alaskan and Continental U.S. populations (F-CT = 0.021, p << 0.001), and a mitochondrial genetic cline near Cape Mendocino (F-CT = 0.132, p < 0.01). We also found single collections genetically divergent from neighboring collections. Like yellowtail rockfish, oceanographic dispersal barriers and northern range expansion were inferred to influence black rockfish, however, unlike yellowtail rockfish, Cape Mendocino did not split the range into two stocks and was, therefore, inferred to be a less severe barrier. We hypothesize a higher frequency of extinction/recolonization events in black rockfish populations may have led to more complex genetic structure.","[Hess, Jon E.; Moran, Paul] Northwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, 2725 Montlake Blvd East, Seattle, WA 98112 USA; [Hyde, John R.] Southwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, 8901 La Jolla Shores Dr, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Hess, Jon E.] Columbia River Intertribal Fish Commiss, 700 NE Multnomah St,Suite 1200, Portland, OR 97232 USA","","Hess, JE (corresponding author), Northwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, 2725 Montlake Blvd East, Seattle, WA 98112 USA.;Hess, JE (corresponding author), Columbia River Intertribal Fish Commiss, 700 NE Multnomah St,Suite 1200, Portland, OR 97232 USA.","hesj@critfc.org","Moran, Paul/B-1740-2010; Hess, Jon/F-5124-2012","Hess, Jon/0000-0002-3643-202X","National Research Council post-doctoral fellowship program; Conservation biology division resources at the NOAA Northwest Fisheries Science Center in Seattle","National Research Council post-doctoral fellowship program; Conservation biology division resources at the NOAA Northwest Fisheries Science Center in Seattle(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA)","This work was supported by the National Research Council post-doctoral fellowship program as well as the conservation biology division resources at the NOAA Northwest Fisheries Science Center in Seattle",NA,82,0,0,3,9,"SPRINGER HEIDELBERG","HEIDELBERG","TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY","0025-3162","1432-1793","","MAR BIOL","Mar.

Mote Marine Laboratory & Aquarium is an independent, non-profit marine science organization dedicated to the conservation and restoration of Florida's Coral Reef, and does so, using science-based strategies. In order to promote the long-term persistence, resilience, and adaptive potential of restored coral populations on Florida's Coral Reef, Mote scientists are performing critical research and restoration activities related to assisted sexual reproduction (ASR). The objective of this study was to optimize ASR of Acropora cervicornis by (1) evaluating broodstock compatibility for genets actively used within Mote's restoration gene pool, (2) optimizing larval settlement by testing spectral cues, (3) and optimizing the grow-out of sexual recruits by testing the impact of light on growth, survival, and algal symbiont uptake in the presence of adult corals or not. Overall, we found that corals and genets spawned with high synchrony, both within and across years, and in terms of predicted spawning times related to nights after the full moon and minutes after sunset. Across two years, overall fertilization success was high (similar to 95%), but we did find one pair of genets that was not compatible. During settlement, larvae preferred pink and purple-colored substrates, which was consistent with our expectation that they would select substrates similar in color to crustose coralline algae (CCA). Interestingly though, they only did so when a matching chemical cue from CCA was also present, indicating that larvae integrate multiple cues simultaneously to determine the most appropriate place to settle. Growth and symbiont uptake were faster in recruits reared in the presence of adult corals and additional lighting, but survivorship was not different through the first ten weeks post-settlement between treatments. A subset of corals was outplanted using two different techniques based on single or clustered corals. We report the initial 1-month survival results. We also provide a detailed protocol and general recommendations for ASR based on years of coral sexual propagation experience.","[Koch, Hanna R.

Barrier removal or modifications that allow upstream access can result in expanded distributions, increased abundances, and gene flow among historically isolated populations. Actions that promote connectivity, gene flow, and the potential expression of multiple life history forms (e.g., anadromy in Pacific salmon Oncorhynchus spp.) are thought to buffer against extinction and are increasingly important given the high rates of imperilment for many fish species. We collected genetic samples from juvenile O. mykiss (anadromous steelhead and resident Rainbow Trout) prior to and following the modification of a culvert that served as a historical barrier to upstream movement and tested for changes in genetic composition through time. Prior to culvert modification, levels of genetic diversity were low and genetic differentiation with reference collections of anadromous steelhead was high. After treatment, we observed increased levels of genetic diversity, larger estimates of effective population size, and decreased genetic differentiation with steelhead, indicating an influx of individuals from a downstream population. Using an inexpensive genetic-based monitoring approach, we show that culvert modification can result in the rapid reestablishment of connectivity between historically isolated populations.","[Knoth, Brian A.; Dobos, Marika; Bowersox, Brett J.] Idaho Dept Fish & Game, 3316 16th St, Lewiston, ID 83501 USA; [Hargrove, John S.] Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commiss, 1800 Trout Rd, Eagle, ID 83616 USA; [Copeland, Timothy] Idaho Dept Fish & Game, 600 Walnut St, Boise, ID 83707 USA","","Hargrove, JS (corresponding author), Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commiss, 1800 Trout Rd, Eagle, ID 83616 USA.","john.hargrove@idfg.idaho.gov","","Copeland, Timothy/0000-0003-4967-2468; Hargrove, John/0000-0002-8643-7822","Pacific Coastal Salmon Recovery Funds; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Intensively Monitored Watershed Funds [18-29G]","Pacific Coastal Salmon Recovery Funds; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Intensively Monitored Watershed Funds(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA)","We would like to thank the staff at Eagle Fish Genetics Laboratory, who helped process genetic samples and data, including Dylan Kovis and Jesse McCane.

Marine blue holes are shallow karst formations characterized by low oxygen and high organic matter content. They are logistically challenging to sample, and thus our understanding of their biogeochemistry and microbial ecology is limited. We present a metagenomic and geochemical characterization of Amberjack Hole on the Florida continental shelf (Gulf of Mexico). Dissolved oxygen became depleted at the hole's rim (32 m water depth), remained low but detectable in an intermediate hypoxic zone (40-75 m), and then increased to a secondary peak before falling below detection in the bottom layer (80-110 m), concomitant with increases in nutrients, dissolved iron, and a series of sequentially more reduced sulfur species. Microbial communities in the bottom layer contained heretofore undocumented levels of the recently discovered phylum Woesearchaeota (up to 58% of the community), along with lineages in the bacterial Candidate Phyla Radiation (CPR). Thirty-one high-quality metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) showed extensive biochemical capabilities for sulfur and nitrogen cycling, as well as for resisting and respiring arsenic. One uncharacterized gene associated with a CPR lineage differentiated hypoxic from anoxic zone communities. Overall, microbial communities and geochemical profiles were stable across two sampling dates in the spring and fall of 2019. The blue hole habitat is a natural marine laboratory that provides opportunities for sampling taxa with under-characterized but potentially important roles in redox-stratified microbial processes.","[Patin, N.

While the precise mechanisms for this loss of individual fitness are not well understood, they involve the disruption of early cardiogenesis and a subsequent pathological remodeling of the heart much later in juveniles. This developmental cardiotoxicity is attributable, in turn, to the inhibitory actions of crude oil-derived mixtures of polycyclic aromatic compounds (PACs) on specific ion channels and other proteins that collectively drive the rhythmic contractions of heart muscle cells via excitation-contraction coupling. Here we exposed Pacific herring (Clupea pallasi) embryos to oiled gravel effluent yielding Sigma PAC concentrations as low as similar to 1 mu g/L (64 ng/g in tissues). Upon hatching in clean seawater, and following the depuration of tissue PACs (as evidenced by basal levels of cyp1 alpha gene expression), the ventricles of larval herring hearts showed a concentration-dependent reduction in posterior growth (ballooning). This was followed weeks later in feeding larvae by abnormal trabeculation, or formation of the finger-like projections of interior spongy myocardium, and months later with hypertrophy (overgrowth) of the spongy myocardium in early juveniles. Given that heart muscle cell differentiation and migration are driven by Ca2+-dependent intracellular signaling, the observed disruption of ventricular morphogenesis was likely a secondary (downstream) consequence of reduced calcium cycling and contractility in embryonic cardiomyocytes. We propose defective trabeculation as a promising phenotypic anchor for novel morphometric indicators of latent cardiac injury in oil-exposed herring, including an abnormal persistence of cardiac jelly in the ventricle wall and cardiomyocyte hyperproliferation. At a corresponding molecular level, quantitative expression assays in the present study also support biomarker roles for genes known to be involved in muscle contractility (atp2a2, myl7, myh7), cardiomyocyte precursor fate (nkx2.5) and ventricular trabeculation (nrg2, and hbegf alpha). Overall, our findings reinforce both proximal and indirect roles for dysregulated intracellular calcium cycling in the canonical fish early life stage crude oil toxicity syndrome. More work on Ca2+-mediated cellular dynamics and transcription in developing cardiomyocytes is needed. Nevertheless, the highly specific actions of Sigma PAC mixtures on the heart at low, parts-per-billion tissue concentrations directly contravene classical assumptions of baseline (i.e., non-specific) crude oil toxicity.","[Incardona, John P.; Linbo, Tiffany L.; French, Barbara L.; Peck, Karen A.; Laetz, Cathy A.; Boyd, Daryle T.; Ylitalo, Gina M.; Scholz, Nathaniel L.] NOAA, Northwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Seattle, WA 98115 USA; [Cameron, James] NOAA, Northwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Earth Resources Technol, Seattle, WA USA; [Hicks, Mary Beth; Hutchinson, Greg] Oregon State Univ, Hatfield Marine Sci Ctr, Cooperat Inst Marine Resources Studies, Newport, OR USA; [Allan, Sarah E.] NOAA, Off Response & Restorat, Anchorage, AK USA","National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Oregon State University; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA","Incardona, JP (corresponding author), NOAA, Northwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Seattle, WA 98115 USA.","john.incardona@noaa.gov","; Scholz, Nathaniel/L-1642-2013","French, Barbara/0000-0002-2358-9044; Scholz, Nathaniel/0000-0001-6207-0272; Cameron, James/0000-0001-6180-6049","NOAA National Ocean Service, Office of Response and Restoration, Assessment and Restoration Division","NOAA National Ocean Service, Office of Response and Restoration, Assessment and Restoration Division","We thank Mary Arkoosh for use of wet and dry lab space at the Newport facility; Joe Dietrich for assistance with designing and building the exposure system and preparing growth tanks; Paul Iseri for small boat operations and herring fishing; Jana Labenia, David Baldwin, Jessica Lundin, and Julann Spromberg for assistance with exposures and sampling; and Paul Hershberger and Jake Gregg for providing juvenile herring for the comparative qPCR in heart and swimming muscle samples.

DNA extraction and analysis by DNA sequencing of genetic markers is the only method to determine species identity reliably, yet these methods are significantly compromised when DNA becomes degraded. To evaluate the role that time and environment play in obtaining high-quality DNA sequencing data, we placed skeletal elements of a terrestrial mammal (Bos taurus) and L. kempii in a supratidal and subtidal environment for 3 years. Bi-annual sampling revealed that after 3 years, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) consistently identified each species from each environment. Our results show that mtDNA recovery from bone and identification for Kemp's ridley sea turtles was possible up to 3 years in both environments. All sequencing data obtained was accurate and robust, but DNA sequencing results were not consistent after 664-days of exposure. Our findings led us to conclude that if sufficient DNA is extracted from bone samples, then high-quality sequence data can be obtained, and the resulting sequence data accurately reflects the reference sequence for the given gene marker. This study provides evidence that DNA can be extracted and analyzed from challenging biological substrates, like bone, when these substrates are exposed to seasonally dynamic maritime environmental conditions for up to 3-years.","[Krestoff, Elizabeth S.; Creecy, James P.; Lord, Wayne D.] Univ Cent Oklahoma, Roger Webb Forens Sci Inst, Edmond, OK 73034 USA; [Creecy, James P.; Lord, Wayne D.; Haynie, Michelle L.; Coyer, James A.] Univ Cent Oklahoma, Ctr Wildlife Forens Sci & Conservat Studies, Edmond, OK 73034 USA; [Creecy, James P.; Lord, Wayne D.; Haynie, Michelle L.; Coyer, James A.] Univ Cent Oklahoma, Dept Biol, Edmond, OK 73034 USA; [Lord, Wayne D.; Coyer, James A.] Cornell Univ, Shoals Marine Lab, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Lord, Wayne D.; Coyer, James A.] Univ New Hampshire, Durham, NH 03824 USA; [Sampson, Kate] NOAA, Dept Commerce, Greater Atlantic Reg Fisheries Off, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Gloucester, MA USA","University of Central Oklahoma; University of Central Oklahoma; University of Central Oklahoma; Cornell University; University System Of New Hampshire; University of New Hampshire; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)","Creecy, JP (corresponding author), Univ Cent Oklahoma, Roger Webb Forens Sci Inst, Edmond, OK 73034 USA.;Creecy, JP (corresponding author), Univ Cent Oklahoma, Ctr Wildlife Forens Sci & Conservat Studies, Edmond, OK 73034 USA.;Creecy, JP (corresponding author), Univ Cent Oklahoma, Dept Biol, Edmond, OK 73034 USA.","jcreecy@uco.edu","Coyer, James/B-3295-2010","","Kirkpatrick Foundation; University of Central Oklahoma's Student Transformative Learning Record (STLR) , a Department of Education Title III grant program","Kirkpatrick Foundation; University of Central Oklahoma's Student Transformative Learning Record (STLR) , a Department of Education Title III grant program","We would like to acknowledge significant research funding from the Kirkpatrick Foundation.

Most practitioners classify backscatter based on direct sampling, frequency-difference thresholds, and expert judgement, then echo-integrate at a single frequency. However, this approach struggles with species mixtures, and discards multi-frequency information when integrating. Inversion methods do not have these limitations, but are not widely used because species identifications are often ambiguous and the algorithms are complicated to implement. We address these shortcomings using a probabilistic, Bayesian inversion method. Like other inversion methods, it handles species mixtures, uses all available frequencies, and extends naturally to broadband signals. Unlike previous approaches, it leverages Bayesian priors to rigorously incorporate information from direct sampling and biological knowledge, constraining the inversion and reducing ambiguity in species identification. Because it is probabilistic, a well-specified model should not produce solutions that are both wrong and confident. The model is based on physical scattering processes, so its output is fully interpretable, unlike some machine learning methods. Finally, the approach can be implemented using existing Bayesian libraries and is easily parallelized for large datasets. We present examples using simulations and field data from the Gulf of Alaska, and discuss possible applications and extensions of the method.","[Urmy, Samuel S.; De Robertis, Alex] NOAA, Resource Assessment & Conservat Engn Div, Alaska Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, 7600 Sand Point Way NE, Seattle, WA 98115 USA; [Bassett, Christopher] Univ Washington, Appl Phys Lab, 1013 NE 40th St, Seattle, WA 98105 USA","National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle","Urmy, SS (corresponding author), NOAA, Resource Assessment & Conservat Engn Div, Alaska Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, 7600 Sand Point Way NE, Seattle, WA 98115 USA.","sam.urmy@noaa.gov","","Urmy, Samuel/0000-0003-2663-6253; De Robertis, Alex/0000-0001-6268-0791","","","",NA,80,2,3,5,10,"OXFORD UNIV PRESS","OXFORD","GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","1054-3139","1095-9289","","ICES J MAR SCI","ICES J.

One component of oyster hatcheries that may contribute to the health of oyster larvae is the early establishment and subsequent development of the oyster larval microbiome. The main objectives of this study were to investigate the effects of environmental conditions (hatchery types and spawning seasons) and oyster phenotypes (larval developmental stages) on the composition and diversity of the larval microbiome. In addition, the members of core larval microbiomes were identified and quantified. Microbiome composition and diversity of larval and corresponding hatchery water samples were examined using high throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons and represented three development stages from two different spawning events at four different hatcheries located in Chesapeake Bay tributaries. Larval and water samples from each spawning cohort were taken at 24-hours 'D' shape (D-stage), 1-week veliger (V-stage), and 2-weeks pediveliger (PV-stage). Larval microbiomes were significantly different from water microbiomes and were significantly influenced by hatchery and spawning, with hatchery having the greatest effect on microbiome composition. While development stage did not show a significant effect on the larval microbiomes, there was a decrease in species richness from the initial D-stage larvae through the final PV-stage and nMDS clustering patterns showed some separation between early (Dand V-) and late stages (PV-) of development, suggesting a shift towards a more selective microbiome as the larvae developed. A total of 25 members (OTU level) were identified as the core larval microbiome (core OTUs), comprising approximately one quarter of the total relative abundance of the larval microbiome. Core OTUs belonging to genera Alteronomonas and Roseobacter have been shown to offer bivalve larvae some protection against pathogens, while those belonging to family Cryomorphaceae are commonly isolated from microalgal species and most likely indicate an association with oyster larval feeding. These findings underscore the importance of environmental conditions on microbiome development of oyster larvae associated with hatchery success of larval cultivation. Further studies are needed to determine the contribution of the core larval microbiome to oyster health and disease resistance.","[Arfken, Ann; Song, Bongkeun; Allen, Standish K., Jr.; Carnegie, Ryan B.] William & Mary, Virginia Inst Marine Sci, POB 1346, Gloucester Point, VA 23062 USA; [Arfken, Ann] ARS, Anim Biosci & Biotechnol Lab, USDA, Beltsville, MD 20705 USA","William & Mary; Virginia Institute of Marine Science; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)","Song, B (corresponding author), William & Mary, Virginia Inst Marine Sci, POB 1346, Gloucester Point, VA 23062 USA.","songb@vims.edu","","Carnegie, Ryan/0009-0001-8667-4270; Song, Bongkeun/0000-0002-6645-7025","Virginia Sea Development Grant; National Science Foundation in USA [OCE 1321373]; NOAA Sea Grant 2017 Aquaculture Initiative","Virginia Sea Development Grant; National Science Foundation in USA(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NOAA Sea Grant 2017 Aquaculture Initiative(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA)","I thank the commercial hatcheries for their participation this study and Raegan Bostic for assistance with sample processing.

Phosphorylation of eIF2 alpha inhibits overall protein synthesis, but also facilitates the reprogramming of gene expression to adapt to, and recover from, stress. The deduced coding sequence of cobia eIF2 alpha has 94% identity to both zebrafish (Danio rerio) and human eIF2 alpha sequences with identical phosphorylation and kinase docking sites. Here we use cobia larvae and a cobia cell line derived from muscle (Cm cells) to investigate the response of cobia eIF2 alpha to various stressors. In Cm cells, phosphorylation of eIF2 alpha is increased by nutrient deficiency and endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER stress), consistent with the activation of the eIF2 kinases, GCN2, and PERK. In cobia juveniles, diet and water temperature affect the phosphorylation state of eIF2 alpha. We conclude that evaluation of eIF2 alpha phosphorylation could function as an early marker to evaluate diet, environmental stressors, and disease in cobia and may be of particular use in optimizing conditions for rearing cobia larvae and juveniles.","[Liu, Chieh Lun; Place, Allen R.; Jagus, Rosemary] Univ Maryland, Inst Marine & Environm Biotechnol, Ctr Environm Sci, 701 E Pratt St, Baltimore, MD 21202 USA; [Dasi, Erica A.] Univ S Florida, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Tampa, FL 33620 USA; [Watson, Aaron M.] Marine Resources Res Inst, South Carolina Dept Nat Resources, 217 Ft Johnson Rd, Charleston, SC 29412 USA","University System of Maryland; University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science; University of Maryland Baltimore; State University System of Florida; University of South Florida","Jagus, R (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Inst Marine & Environm Biotechnol, Ctr Environm Sci, 701 E Pratt St, Baltimore, MD 21202 USA.","jerrenliu@gmail.com; eadasi@usf.edu; watsona@dnr.sc.gov; place@umces.edu; jagus@umces.edu","Watson, Aaron/H-8752-2019","Watson, Aaron/0000-0001-5180-7750","Ministry of Education, Republic of China (Taiwan); NOAA-EPP [NA11SEC4810002]; LMRCSC undergraduate internship funds; University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science (UMCES) [6179]","Ministry of Education, Republic of China (Taiwan)(Ministry of Education, Taiwan); NOAA-EPP(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); LMRCSC undergraduate internship funds; University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science (UMCES)","C.L.L. was supported in part by a scholarship from the Ministry of Education, Republic of China (Taiwan).

The physiological capabilities facilitating the ecological success of pelagophytes in these diverse ecosystems remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated the transcriptional response of two coastal pelagophytes (Aureococcus anophagefferens and Aureoumbra lagunensis) and two open ocean pelagophytes (Pelagococcus subviridis and Pelagomonas calceolata) to conditions commonly found within the marine ecosystems where they thrive: low concentrations of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), or light. OrthoMCL was used to generate a total of 62,653 orthologous groups (OGs) with only a small fraction of these OGs (2,776 or 4.4%) being shared among all four pelagophytes. Of the commonly shared OGs, 8% were significantly differentially abundant under low N, P, or light with the majority associated with energy and lipid metabolism. Distinct responses among pelagophytes included increased abundance of transcripts encoding phosphate transporters (Aureococcus) and transcripts encoding a pyrophosphatase (Aureococcus and Pelagomonas) under low P, the expression of a suite of organic nitrogen-degrading enzymes under low N (Aureoumbra and Pelagomonas), increased abundance of transcripts encoding flavodoxins relative to ferredoxins (Pelagomonas) and transcripts encoding lysophospholipase (Pelagococcus) under low light, and both increases and decreases in abundance of transcripts encoding selenoproteins in all pelagophytes except Pelagococcus. Collectively, this study provides new information on the expressed gene compliment of these poorly characterized taxa and demonstrates that these pelagophytes possess a combination of shared and unique physiological features that likely facilitate their adaptation to distinct environmental conditions.","[Kang, Yoonja; Harke, Matthew J.; Berry, Dianna L.; Collier, Jackie L.; Gobler, Christopher J.] SUNY Stony Brook, Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; [Wilhelm, Steven W.] Univ Tennessee, Dept Microbiol, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA; [Dyhrman, Sonya T.] Columbia Univ, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, New York, NY USA; [Dyhrman, Sonya T.] Columbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, Palisades, NY USA; [Kang, Yoonja] Chonnam Natl Univ, Dept Ocean Integrated Sci, Yeosu, South Korea; [Harke, Matthew J.] Gloucester Marine Genom Inst, Gloucester, MA USA","State University of New York (SUNY) System; Stony Brook University; University of Tennessee System; University of Tennessee Knoxville; Columbia University; Columbia University; Chonnam National University","Gobler, CJ (corresponding author), SUNY Stony Brook, Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA.","christopher.gobler@stonybrook.edu","Dyhrman, Sonya/JAO-1091-2023; Collier, Jackie/AFF-7928-2022; Kang, Yoonja/AAI-1725-2021; Wilhelm, Steven/B-8963-2008","Collier, Jackie/0000-0001-8774-5715; Wilhelm, Steven/0000-0001-6283-8077","Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation's Marine Microbial Eukaryote Transcriptome Sequencing Project (MMETSP); NOAA's ECOHAB program [NA15NOS4780199, NA09NOA4780206, NA15NOS4780183]","Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation's Marine Microbial Eukaryote Transcriptome Sequencing Project (MMETSP); NOAA's ECOHAB program","This project was made possible by a sequencing grant from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation's Marine Microbial Eukaryote Transcriptome Sequencing Project (MMETSP).

The nearshore reef habitats of Palau, Micronesia are a proxy for a future of warmer, more acidic oceans. Coral populations in these habitats can resist, and recover from, episodes of thermal stress better than offshore conspecifics. To explore the physiological basis of this tolerance, we compared tissue biomass (ash-free dry weight cm(-2)), energy reserves (i.e., protein, total lipid, carbohydrate content), and several important lipid classes in six coral species living in both offshore and nearshore environments. In contrast to expectations, a trend emerged of many nearshore colonies exhibiting lower biomass and energy reserves than colonies from offshore sites, which may be explained by the increased metabolic demand of living in a warmer, acidic, environment. Despite hosting different dinoflagellate symbiont species and having access to contrasting prey abundances, total lipid and lipid class compositions were similar in colonies from each habitat. Ultimately, while the regulation of colony biomass and energy reserves may be influenced by factors, including the identity of the resident symbiont, kind of food consumed, and host genetic attributes, these independent processes converged to a similar homeostatic set point under different environmental conditions.","[Keister, Elise F.; Gantt, Shelby E.; Kemp, Dustin W.] Univ Alabama Birmingham, Dept Biol, Birmingham, AL 35294 USA; [Reich, Hannah G.] Univ New Hampshire, Dept Biol Sci, Durham, NH USA; [Turnham, Kira E.; LaJeunesse, Todd C.] Penn State Univ, Dept Biol, State Coll, PA USA; [Bateman, Timothy G.; Warner, Mark E.] Univ Delaware, Sch Marine Sci & Policy, Lewes, DE USA","University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Birmingham; University System Of New Hampshire; University of New Hampshire; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; University of Delaware","Keister, EF; Kemp, DW (corresponding author), Univ Alabama Birmingham, Dept Biol, Birmingham, AL 35294 USA.","ekeister@uab.edu; dwk@uab.edu","Warner, Mark/J-6241-2013; Turnham, Kira/I-7458-2015; LaJeunesse, Todd/B-1720-2009","Kemp, Dustin/0000-0002-9396-1518; Reich, Hannah/0000-0002-8622-8801; Gantt, Shelby/0000-0002-7340-8037; Warner, Mark/0000-0003-1015-9413; Keister, Elise F./0000-0002-8444-8317; Turnham, Kira/0000-0001-9236-7237; LaJeunesse, Todd/0000-0001-7607-9358","National Science Foundation [IOS-1258065, OCE-1635695, IOS-1258058, OCE-1636022, OCE-1719684, IOS-1719675]; NOAA Dr. Nancy Foster Scholarship [NA19NOS4290102]","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NOAA Dr. Nancy Foster Scholarship","We thank the staff and scientists at the Palau International Coral Research Center (PICRC) for all their assistance and logistical support.

Methane hydrates are ephemeral features of deep-sea cold seeps, and finding worm-colonized hydrates is rare; thus, little is known about these organisms. Recent metagenomic analysis predicted prokaryotic taxa and pathways from S. methanicola gut contents and worm fragments. Here, we increase the genetic information known about S. methanicola by assembling its nuclear rRNA genes (18S rRNA and 28S rRNA), mitochondrial genome (mitogenome), and other protein-coding genes from metagenomic data. Assembled 18S rRNA and 28S rRNA gene sequences of S. methanicola were near-identical to previously reported S. methanicola sequences. The 17,403-bp mitogenome of S. methanicola is the first mitogenome sequence of the family Hesionidae, consisting of 39.03% G+C content, 13 protein-coding genes, 24 tRNAs (including two split trnM genes), and 2 rRNA genes. Protein-coding genes in the S. methanicola metagenomes assigned to the phylum Annelida were involved in cell adhesion, signaling, ubiquitin system, metabolism, transport, and other processes. From the metagenomes, we also found 42 homologs of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) superfamily putatively involved in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) metabolism.

Here, monthly time-series samples of surface seawater along a transect spanning the nearshore coastal environment within Kane.ohe Bay on the island of O.ahu, Hawai.i, and the adjacent offshore environment were collected to investigate the diversity and abundance of SAR11 marine bacteria (order Pelagibacterales) over a 2-year time period. Using 16S ribosomal RNA gene amplicon sequencing, the spatiotemporal distributions of major SAR11 subclades and exact amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) were evaluated. Seven of eight SAR11 subclades detected in this study showed distinct subclade distributions across the coastal to offshore environments. The SAR11 community was dominated by seven (of 106 total) SAR11 ASVs that made up an average of 77% of total SAR11. These seven ASVs spanned five different SAR11 subclades (Ia, Ib, IIa, IV, and Va), and were recovered from all samples collected from either the coastal environment, the offshore, or both. SAR11 ASVs were more often restricted spatially to coastal or offshore environments (64 of 106 ASVs) than they were shared among coastal, transition, and offshore environments (39 of 106 ASVs). Overall, offshore SAR11 communities contained a higher diversity of SAR11 ASVs than their nearshore counterparts, with the highest diversity within the little-studied subclade IIa. This study reveals ecological differentiation of SAR11 marine bacteria across a short physiochemical gradient, further increasing our understanding of how SAR11 genetic diversity partitions into distinct ecological units.","[Tucker, Sarah J.; Freel, Kelle C.; Monaghan, Elizabeth A.; Sullivan, Clarisse E.

Although the immune system of Drosophila melanogaster is extensively studied, little is known about the fly's specific responses to infection by A. flavus. We compared gene expression levels during induced infections in D. melanogaster by a virulent A. flavus isolate and a less virulent isolate, as well as from uninfected flies as a control. We found that 1081 of the 14,554 gene regions detected were significantly differentially expressed among treatments. Some of these up- and down- regulated genes were previously shown to be involved in defense responses against pathogens. Some are known to be involved in vitelline membrane formation in flies. Other up- and down-regulated genes are of unknown function. Understanding expression of these genes during the process of infection in flies should improve our knowledge of innate immunity in invertebrates, and by extension, in vertebrates as well.","[Ramirez-Camejo, Luis A.] Purdue Univ, Dept Bot & Plant Pathol, W Lafayette, IN 47901 USA; [Ramirez-Camejo, Luis A.; Bayman, Paul] Univ Puerto Rico Rio Piedras, Dept Biol, San Juan, PR 00931 USA; [Ramirez-Camejo, Luis A.] Coiba Sci Stn COIBA AIP, Panama City, Panama","Purdue University System; Purdue University; University of Puerto Rico; University of Puerto Rico Rio Piedras","Ramrez-Camejo, LA (corresponding author), Purdue Univ, Dept Bot & Plant Pathol, W Lafayette, IN 47901 USA.","ramirezcamejo@gmail.com","","Ramirez-Camejo, Luis Alberto/0000-0001-6844-7843","University of Puerto Rico Sea Grant [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) award] [NA16RG2278, NA170P2919, R-92-2-08]; University of Puerto Rico Sea Grant [National Science Foundation-Center for Applied Tropical Ecology and Conservation (NSF-CREST)] [HRD0734826]; University of Puerto Rico Sea Grant [National Institutes of Health-Support of Continuous Research Excellence (NIHSCORE)] [2S06GM08102]; Secretaria Nacional de Ciencia, Tecnologia e Innovacion of Panama; Sistema Nacional de Investigacion of Panama","University of Puerto Rico Sea Grant [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) award](National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); University of Puerto Rico Sea Grant [National Science Foundation-Center for Applied Tropical Ecology and Conservation (NSF-CREST)]; University of Puerto Rico Sea Grant [National Institutes of Health-Support of Continuous Research Excellence (NIHSCORE)]; Secretaria Nacional de Ciencia, Tecnologia e Innovacion of Panama; Sistema Nacional de Investigacion of Panama","This study was part of the doctoral thesis of Luis A.

The sustainable development of eastern oyster aquaculture depends upon the continued improvement of cultured stocks through advanced breeding technologies. The Eastern Oyster Breeding Consortium (EOBC) was formed to advance the genetics and breeding of the eastern oyster. To facilitate efficient genotyping needed for genomic studies and selection, the consortium developed two single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays for the eastern oyster: one screening array with 566K SNPs and one breeders' array with 66K SNPs. The 566K screening array was developed based on whole-genome resequencing data from 292 oysters from Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico populations; it contains 566,262 SNPs including 47K from protein-coding genes with a marker conversion rate of 48.34%. The 66K array was developed using best-performing SNPs from the screening array, which contained 65,893 oyster SNPs including 22,984 genic markers with a calling rate of 99.34%, a concordance rate of 99.81%, and a much-improved marker conversion rate of 92.04%. Null alleles attributable to large indels were found in 13.1% of the SNPs, suggesting that copy number variation is pervasive. Both arrays provided easy identification and separation of selected stocks from wild progenitor populations. The arrays contain 31 mitochondrial SNPs that allowed unambiguous identification of Gulf mitochondrial genotypes in some Atlantic populations. The arrays also contain 756 probes from 13 oyster and human pathogens for possible detection. Our results show that marker conversion rate is low in high polymorphism species and that the two-step process of array development can greatly improve array performance. The two arrays will advance genomic research and accelerate genetic improvement of the eastern oyster by delineating genetic architecture of production traits and enabling genomic selection. The arrays also may be used to monitor pedigree and inbreeding, identify selected stocks and their introgression into wild populations, and assess the success of oyster restoration.","[Guo, Ximing; Wang, Zhenwei; Haggard, Jaime; Chriss, Noah; Zeng, Dan; Bushek, David] Rutgers State Univ, Haskin Shellfish Res Lab, 6959 Miller Ave, Port Norris, NJ 08349 USA; [Puritz, Jonathan B.] Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Biol Sci, 120 Flagg Rd, Kingston, RI 02881 USA; [Proestou, Dina; Lundgren, Kathryn] ARS, USDA, NCWMAC Shellfish Genet Lab, 120 Flagg Rd, Kingston, RI 02881 USA; [Allen, Standish, Jr.; Small, Jessica] Virginia Inst Marine Sci, 1375 Greate Rd, Gloucester Point, VA 23062 USA; [Verbyla, Klara] CSIRO, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; [Zhao, Honggang; Hare, Matthew] Cornell Univ, Dept Nat Resources & Environm, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Allam, Bassem] SUNY Stony Brook, Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; [Gomez-Chiarri, Marta] Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Fisheries Anim & Vet Sci, 120 Flagg Rd, Kingston, RI 02881 USA; [Hollenbeck, Christopher] Texas A&M Univ, Texas A&M AgriLife Res, 6300 Ocean Dr Unit 5892, Corpus Christi, TX 78412 USA; [La Peyre, Jerome] Louisiana State Univ, Agr Ctr, Sch Anim Sci, 201 Anim & Food Sci Lab Bldg,Forestry Lane, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; [Liu, Ming] Morgan State Univ, Patuxent Environm & Aquat Res Lab, 10545 Mackall Rd, St Leonard, MD 20685 USA; [Lotterhos, Katie E.] Northeastern Marine Sci Ctr, 430 Nahant Rd, Nahant, MA 01908 USA; [Plough, Louis] Univ Maryland, Horn Point Lab, 5745 Lovers Lane, Cambridge, MD 21613 USA; [Rawson, Paul] Univ Maine, Sch Marine Sci, 5751 Murray Hall, Orono, ME 04469 USA; [Rikard, Scott] Auburn Univ, Shellfish Lab, Sch Fisheries Aquaculture & Aquat Sci, 150 Agassiz St, Dauphin Isl, AL 36528 USA; [Saillant, Eric] Univ Southern Mississippi, Sch Ocean Sci & Engn, 103 McIlwain Dr, Ocean Springs, MS 39564 USA; [Varney, Robin; Wilbur, Ami] Univ N Carolina, Shellfish Res Hatchery, 5600 Marvin K Moss Ln, Wilmington, NC 28409 USA; [Wikfors, Gary] NOAA Fisheries, Milford CT Lab, 212 Rogers Ave, Milford, CT 06460 USA","Rutgers University System; Rutgers University New Brunswick; University of Rhode Island; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); William & Mary; Virginia Institute of Marine Science; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Cornell University; State University of New York (SUNY) System; Stony Brook University; University of Rhode Island; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; Texas A&M AgriLife Research; Louisiana State University System; Louisiana State University; Morgan State University; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science; University of Maine System; University of Maine Orono; Auburn University System; Auburn University; University of Southern Mississippi; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Wilmington; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA","Guo, XM (corresponding author), Rutgers State Univ, Haskin Shellfish Res Lab, 6959 Miller Ave, Port Norris, NJ 08349 USA.","xguo@rutgers.edu","Puritz, Jonathan/C-9289-2011; Verbyla, Klara/D-9907-2019; Liu, Ming/ABC-8369-2020; Plough, Louis/E-1413-2014; Guo, Ximing/K-3804-2012","Gomez-Chiarri, Marta/0000-0002-2576-9612; Lotterhos, Kathleen/0000-0001-7529-2771; Plough, Louis/0000-0001-5572-9649; Guo, Ximing/0000-0002-6758-2709; Liu, Ming/0000-0002-6454-7297; Small, Jessica/0009-0002-2640-8170","National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), United States Department of Commerce through the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission [NA18NMF4720321]; NOAA through the Gulf States Marine Fisheries Commission [NA15NMF4720399, ACQ-210-039-2019-USM]; Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) [HR0011122C0136]; USDA NIFA Animal Health [1021665/NJ30401, 1009201/NJ32114]","National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), United States Department of Commerce through the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); NOAA through the Gulf States Marine Fisheries Commission(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)(United States Department of DefenseDefense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)); USDA NIFA Animal Health","The study is conducted by the Eastern Oyster Breeding Consortium under support from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), United States Department of Commerce through the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission (award number NA18NMF4720321).

My early scientific career focused on applying phylogenetic and genomic approaches to characterize 'wild' bacteria, archaea and viruses in their natural habitats, with an emphasis on marine systems. These central interests have not changed very much for me over the past three decades, but knowledge, methodological advances and new theoretical perspectives about the microbial world certainly have. In this invited 'How we did it' perspective, I trace some of the trajectories of my lab's collective efforts over the years, including phylogenetic surveys of microbial assemblages in marine plankton and sediments, development of microbial community gene- and genome-enabled surveys, and application of genome-guided, cultivation-independent functional characterization of novel enzymes, pathways and their relationships to in situ biogeochemistry.

Although it has been observed in clams since the 1960's and cultivated since the 1990's, conflicting reports on important aspects of its biology have prevented its formal description. 18S rRNA gene sequences identify QPX as a thraustochytrid, but its production of copious mucus is atypical for this group. There are also conflicting reports about whether QPX shares common features of thraustochytrids, such as the production of an ectoplasmic net and biflagellate zoospores. This study reaffirms the previous descriptions of zoospore production by QPX in culture, in multiple strains from several geographic locations, and provides detail on how to maintain QPX cultures under conditions that promote the production of zoospores. Furthermore, we describe new aspects of the life cycle not previously observed. Finally, we erect Mucochytrium quahogii gen. nov., sp. nov. to accommodate this unusual thraustochytrid.

This recognition led to an increasing reliance on DNA sequence data, particularly rDNA gene segments, in defining species. The validity of this approach assumes the divergence in rDNA or other selected genes parallels speciation events. Another concern is whether single gene rDNA phylogenies by themselves are adequate for delineating species or if multigene phylogenies are required instead. Currently, few studies have directly assessed the relative utility of multigene versus rDNA-based phylogenies for distinguishing species. To address this, the current study examined D1-D3 and ITS/5.8S rDNA gene regions, a multi-gene phylogeny, and morphological characters in Gambierdiscus and other related dinoflagellate genera to determine if they produce congruent phylogenies and identify the same species. Data for the analyses were obtained from previous sequencing efforts and publicly available dinoflagellate transcriptomic libraries as well from the additional nine well-characterized Gambierdiscus species transcriptomic libraries generated in this study. The D1-D3 and ITS/5.8S phylogenies successfully identified the described Gambierdiscus and Alexandrium species. Additionally, the data showed that the D1-D3 and multigene phylogenies were equally capable of identifying the same species. The multigene phylogenies, however, showed different relationships among species and are likely to prove more accurate at determining phylogenetic relationships above the species level. These data indicated that D1-D3 and ITS/5.8S rDNA region phylogenies are generally successful for identifying species of Gambierdiscus, and likely those of other dinoflagellates. To assess how broadly general this finding is likely to be, rDNA molecular phylogenies from over 473 manuscripts representing 232 genera and 863 described species of dinoflagellates were reviewed. Results showed the D1-D3 rDNA and ITS phylogenies in combination are capable of identifying 97% of dinoflagellate species including all the species belonging to the genera Alexandrium, Ostreopsis and Gambierdiscus, although it should be noted that multi-gene phylogenies are preferred for inferring relationships among these species. A protocol is presented for determining when D1-D3, confirmed by ITS/5.8S rDNA sequence data, would take precedence over morphological features when describing new dinoflagellate species. This protocol addresses situations such as: a) when a new species is both morphologically and molecularly distinct from other known species; b) when a new species and closely related species are morphologically indistinguishable, but genetically distinct; and c) how to handle potentially cryptic species and cases where morphotypes are clearly distinct but have the same rDNA sequence. The protocol also addresses other molecular, morphological, and genetic approaches required to resolve species boundaries in the small minority of species where the D1-D3/ITS region phylogenies fail.","[Ott, Brittany M.] Univ Maryland, Joint Inst Food Safety & Appl Nutr JIFSAN, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Ott, Brittany M.; Delwiche, Charles F.] Univ Maryland, Cell Biol & Mol Genet, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Litaker, R.

This study aimed to expand the baseline knowledge of using metabolic end points in environmental monitoring by investigating the dreissenid mussel metabolome in the field. Dreissenids were caged at four locations along the Maumee River for 30 days. The mussel metabolome was measured using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and mussel tissue chemical contaminants were analyzed using gas or liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. All Maumee River sites had a distinct mussel metabolome compared to the reference site and revealed changes in the energy metabolism and amino acids. Data also highlighted the importance of considering seasonality or handling effects on the metabolome at the time of sampling. The furthest upstream site presented a specific mussel tissue chemical signature of pesticides (atrazine and metolachlor), while a downstream site, located at Toledo's wastewater treatment plant, was characterized by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and other organic contaminants. Further research into the dreissenid mussel's natural metabolic cycle and metabolic response to specific anthropogenic stressors is necessary before successful implementation of metabolomics in a biomonitoring program.","[Legrand, Elena; Bayless, Amanda L.; Bearden, Daniel W.; Casu, Fabio; Schock, Tracey B.] NIST, Hollings Marine Lab, Charleston, SC 29412 USA; [Edwards, Michael; Johnson, W.

However, Microcystis genomes also harbor numerous biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) encoding the biosynthesis of other secondary metabolites, including many with toxic properties. Most of these BGCs are uncharacterized and currently lack links to biosynthesis products. However, recent field studies show that many of these BGCs are abundant and transcriptionally active in natural communities, suggesting potentially important yet unknown roles in bloom ecology and water quality. Here, we analyzed 21 xenic Microcystis cultures isolated from western Lake Erie to investigate the diversity of the biosynthetic potential of this genus. Through metabologenomic and in silico approaches, we show that these Microcystis strains contain variable BGCs, previously observed in natural populations, and encode distinct metabolomes across cultures. Additionally, we find that the majority of metabolites and gene clusters are uncharacterized, highlighting our limited understanding of the chemical repertoire of Microcystis spp. Due to the complex metabolomes observed in culture, which contain a wealth of diverse congeners as well as unknown metabolites, these results underscore the need to deeply explore and identify secondary metabolites produced by Microcystis beyond microcystins to assess their impacts on human and environmental health. IMPORTANCE The genus Microcystis forms dense cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (cyanoHABs) and can produce the toxin microcystin, which has been responsible for drinking water crises around the world. While microcystins are of great concern, Microcystis also produces an abundance of other secondary metabolites that may be of interest due to their potential for toxicity, ecological importance, or pharmaceutical applications. In this study, we combine genomic and metabolomic approaches to study the genes responsible for the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites as well as the chemical diversity of produced metabolites in Microcystis strains from the Western Lake Erie Culture Collection. This unique collection comprises Microcystis strains that were directly isolated from western Lake Erie, which experiences substantial cyanoHAB events annually and has had negative impacts on drinking water, tourism, and industry.","[Yancey, Colleen E.; Dick, Gregory J.] Univ Michigan, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Hart, Lauren; Hefferan, Sierra; Dick, Gregory J.] Univ Michigan, Program Chem Biol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Hart, Lauren; Mohamed, Osama G.; Newmister, Sean A.; Tripathi, Ashootosh; Sherman, David H.] Univ Michigan, Life Sci Inst, Ann Arbor, MI USA; [Hefferan, Sierra; Sherman, David H.] Univ Michigan, Dept Med Chem, Ann Arbor, MI USA; [Hefferan, Sierra; Sherman, David H.] Univ Michigan, Dept Chem, Ann Arbor, MI USA; [Hefferan, Sierra; Sherman, David H.] Univ Michigan, Dept Microbiol, Ann Arbor, MI USA; [Hefferan, Sierra; Sherman, David H.] Univ Michigan, Dept Immunol, Ann Arbor, MI USA; [Mohamed, Osama G.; Tripathi, Ashootosh] Univ Michigan, Life Sci Inst, Nat Prod Discovery Core, Ann Arbor, MI USA; [Mohamed, Osama G.; Tripathi, Ashootosh; Sherman, David H.] Cairo Univ, Fac Pharm, Pharmacognosy Dept, Cairo, Egypt; [Dick, Gregory J.] Univ Michigan, Cooperat Inst Great Lakes Res CIGLR, Sch Environm & Sustainabil, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Cairo University; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan","Dick, GJ (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.;Dick, GJ (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Program Chem Biol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.;Dick, GJ (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Cooperat Inst Great Lakes Res CIGLR, Sch Environm & Sustainabil, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.","gdick@umich.edu","Dick, Gregory/D-8901-2012","Dick, Gregory/0000-0001-7666-6288; Yancey, Colleen/0000-0002-6078-9483; Sherman, David H./0000-0001-8334-3647; Hart, Lauren/0000-0001-8553-2839","HHS | NIH | National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) [1P01ES028939-01]; National Science Foundation (NSF) [OCE-1840715]; Cooperative Institute for Great Lakes Research (CIGLR) [NA17OAR4320152]; Hans W.

Larval fish are valuable biological material for tuna molecular ecology. However, they have hardly been used to decipher the ABFT population structure, although providing the genetic signal from successful breeders. For the first time, cooperative field collection of tuna larvae during 2014 in the main spawning area for each stock, the Gulf of Mexico (GOM) and the Mediterranean Sea (MED), enabled us to assess the ABFT genetic structure in a precise temporal and spatial frame exclusively through larvae. Partitioning of genetic diversity at nuclear microsatellite loci and in the mitochondrial control region in larvae spawned contemporarily resulted in low significant fixation indices supporting connectivity between spawners in the main reproduction area for each population. No structuring was detected within the GOM after segregating nuclear diversity in larvae spawned in two hydrographically distinct regions, the eastern GOM (eGOM) and the western GOM (wGOM), with the larvae from eGOM being more similar to those collected in the MED than the larvae from wGOM. We performed clustering of genetically characterized ABFT larvae through Bayesian analysis and by Discriminant Analysis of Principal Components (DAPC) supportin g the existence of favorable areas for mixing of ABFT spawners from Western and Eastern stocks, leading to gene flow and apparent connectivity between weakly structured populations. Our findings suggest that the eastern GOM is more prone for the mixing of breeders from the two ABFT populations. Conservation of this valuable resource exploited for centuries calls for intensification of tuna ichthyoplankton research and standardization of genetic tools for monitoring population dynamics.","[Johnstone, Carolina; Maria Quintanilla, Jose; Garcia, Alberto; Laiz-Carrion, Raul] Ctr Oceanog Malaga, Inst Espanol Oceanog, Consejo Super Invest Cient, Malaga, Spain; [Perez, Montse] Ctr Oceanog Vigo, Inst Espanol Oceanog, Consejo Super Invest Cient, Vigo, Spain; [Malca, Estrella] Univ Miami, Cooperat Inst Marine & Atmospher Studies, Miami, FL USA; [Malca, Estrella; Gerard, Trika; Lamkin, John] Natl Ocean & Atmospher Adm, Southeast Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Miami, FL USA; [Lozano-Peral, Diego] Univ Malaga, Ctr Supercomp & Bioinnovac, Serv Cent Apoyo Invest, Malaga, Spain; [Alemany, Francisco] Int Commis Conservat Atlantic Tunas, Madrid, Spain","Spanish Institute of Oceanography; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); Spanish Institute of Oceanography; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); University of Miami; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Universidad de Malaga","Johnstone, C (corresponding author), Ctr Oceanog Malaga, Inst Espanol Oceanog, Consejo Super Invest Cient, Malaga, Spain.","carolina.johnstone@ieo.es","Malca, Estrella/D-7366-2012; Laiz-Carrin, Raul/AAS-2237-2021; QUINTANILLA, JOSE/AAB-6818-2019; Garca, Alberto/HDO-5321-2022; Johnstone, Carolina/K-9907-2014; LAIZ CARRION, RAUL/K-9809-2014; Lozano-Peral, Diego/M-4511-2018; Perez, Montse/E-6741-2013","Malca, Estrella/0000-0002-9182-5854; Quintanilla/0000-0003-1581-5248; Johnstone, Carolina/0000-0002-4966-6212; LAIZ CARRION, RAUL/0000-0003-4604-0430; Lozano-Peral, Diego/0000-0001-8072-0355; Perez, Montse/0000-0002-1772-8984","ECOLATUN PROJECT - Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [CTM2015-68473-R]; NASA [NNX11AP76G S07]; NOAA National Marine Fisheries Science Service through the Southeast Fisheries Science Center; Cooperative Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Studies at the University of Miami, Miami, FL, USA [NA15OAR43200064]; TUNAGEN project - Instituto Espanol de Oceanografia (IEO); BLUEFIN project - IEO; Balearic Island Observing and Forecasting System (SOCIB)","ECOLATUN PROJECT - Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness; NASA(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)); NOAA National Marine Fisheries Science Service through the Southeast Fisheries Science Center(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); Cooperative Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Studies at the University of Miami, Miami, FL, USA; TUNAGEN project - Instituto Espanol de Oceanografia (IEO); BLUEFIN project - IEO; Balearic Island Observing and Forecasting System (SOCIB)","This collaborative study was supported by ECOLATUN PROJECT CTM2015-68473-R (MINECO/FEDER) funded by Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness; TUNAGEN project funded by Instituto Espanol de Oceanografia (IEO); and BLUEFIN project financed by IEO and Balearic Island Observing and Forecasting System (SOCIB).

Aureococcus anophagefferens was the first harmful algal bloom species to have its genome sequenced, an advance that evidenced genes important for adaptation to environmental conditions that prevail during brown tides. To expand the genomic tools available for this species, genomes for four strains were assembled, including three newly sequenced strains and one assembled from publicly available data. These genomes ranged from 57.11 to 73.62 Mb, encoding 13,191-17,404 potential proteins. All strains shared similar to 90% of their encoded proteins as determined by homology searches and shared most functional orthologs as determined by KEGG, although each strain also possessed coding sequences with unique functions. Like the original reference genome, the genomes assembled in this study possessed genes hypothesized to be important in bloom proliferation, including genes involved in organic compound metabolism and growth at low light. Cross-strain informatics and culture experiments suggest that the utilization of purines is a potentially important source of organic nitrogen for brown tides. Analyses of metatranscriptomes from a brown tide event demonstrated that use of a single genome yielded a lower read mapping percentage (similar to 30% of library reads) as compared to a database generated from all available genomes (similar to 43%), suggesting novel information about bloom ecology can be gained from expanding genomic space. This work demonstrates the continued need to sequence ecologically relevant algae to understand the genomic potential and their ecology in the environment.","[Gann, Eric R.; Truchon, Alexander R.; Papoulis, Spiridon E.; Wilhelm, Steven W.] Univ Tennessee, Dept Microbiol, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA; [Dyhrman, Sonya T.] Columbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, Biol & Paleo Environm Div, Palisades, NY 10964 USA; [Dyhrman, Sonya T.] Columbia Univ, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Palisades, NY 10964 USA; [Gobler, Christopher J.] SUNY Stony Brook, Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Stony Brook, NY 11790 USA","University of Tennessee System; University of Tennessee Knoxville; Columbia University; Columbia University; State University of New York (SUNY) System; Stony Brook University","Wilhelm, SW (corresponding author), Univ Tennessee, Dept Microbiol, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA.","wilhelm@utk.edu","Dyhrman, Sonya/JAO-1091-2023; Wilhelm, Steven/B-8963-2008","Truchon, Alexander/0000-0002-7194-6819; Wilhelm, Steven/0000-0001-6283-8077","National Science Foundation [IOS1922958]; Simons Foundation [735077]; NOAA through the ECOHAB Program [NA09NOS4780206, NA15NOS4780199, NA15NOS4780183, 1004]","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Simons Foundation; NOAA through the ECOHAB Program(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA)","T The authors thank Gary LeCleir, Mohammad Moniruzzaman, Helena Pound, Caleb Schuler, and Robbie Martin for discussions about this work.

But despite pervasive phase shifts and macroalgal dominance on many coral reefs, some coral species have persisted. One of those species is Montastraea cavemosa which has been categorized as resilient to a range of biotic and abiotic stressors. In order to understand the mechanism(s) of resistance in this coral, we present the results of a thermal stress and ocean acidification (OA) experiment on M. cavemosa, both its brown and orange color morphs, representing conditions predicted by the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 6.0 scenario in the year 2100. We assessed the community response of the prokaryotic microbiome, the photophysiological response of the endosymbiotic Symbiodiniaceae and the molecular responses of critical pathways in the host by quantifying transcript abundances of genes encoding fluorescent proteins, heat shock proteins, antioxidant enzymes and regulators of apoptosis. After a 12 d acclimatization experiment, no visible bleaching was observed in any treatment, and the excitation pressure on photosystem II of the symbiotic Symbiodiniaceae showed no effects of the independent or interactive effects of thermal stress and OA, while only minor, but significant, changes in the prokaryotic microbiome were observed when exposed to RCP 6.0 predicted OA conditions. At the end of the experiment, the host heat shock protein 90 showed an increase in transcript abundance under the combined effects of thermal stress and OA compared to high temperatures alone, but these treatment groups were not significantly different from treatments under normal temperatures. While Bax, an activator of apoptosis, was significantly higher under thermal stress alone compared to control samples. Taken together, M. cavemosa, exhibits ecological stability over time and this may be based on its physiological persistence, resistance and resilience when experimentally exposed to the ecologically realistic RCP 6.0 climate model predictions.","[Lesser, Michael P.; Jarett, Jessica K.; Fiore, Cara L.; Thompson, Megan M.; Pankey, M.

A novel group of apicomplexans, recently named corallicolids, have been detected in corals inhabiting tropical shallow reefs. These apicomplexans may represent a transitional lifestyle between free-living phototrophs and obligate parasites. To shed light on the evolutionary history of apicomplexans and to investigate their ecology in association with corals, we screened scleractinians, antipatharians, alcyonaceans, and zoantharians from shallow, mesophotic, and deep-sea communities. We detected corallicolid plastids using 16S metabarcoding, sequenced the nuclear 18S rRNA gene of corallicolids from selected samples, assembled and annotated the plastid and mitochondrial genomes from a corallicolid that associates with a deep-sea coral, and screened the metagenomes of four coral species for corallicolids. Results We detected 23 corallicolid plastotypes that were associated with 14 coral species from three orders and depths down to 1400 m. Individual plastotypes were restricted to coral hosts within a single depth zone and within a single taxonomic order of corals. Some clusters of closely related corallicolids were revealed that associated with closely related coral species. However, the presence of divergent corallicolid lineages that associated with similar coral species and depths suggests that corallicolid/coral relations are flexible over evolutionary timescales and that a large diversity of apicomplexans may remain undiscovered. The corallicolid plastid genome from a deep-sea coral contained four genes involved in chlorophyll biosynthesis: the three genes of the LIPOR complex and acsF. Conclusions The presence of corallicolid apicomplexans in corals below the photic zone demonstrates that they are not restricted to shallow-water reefs and are more general anthozoan symbionts. The presence of LIPOR genes in the deep-sea corallicolid precludes a role involving photosynthesis and suggests they may be involved in a different function. Thus, these genes may represent another set of genetic tools whose function was adapted from photosynthesis as the ancestors of apicomplexans evolved towards parasitic lifestyles.","[Vohsen, Samuel A.; Anderson, Kaitlin E.; Gade, Andrea M.; Dannenberg, Richard P.; Osman, Eslam O.; Fisher, Charles R.; Baums, Iliana B.] Penn State Univ, Dept Biol, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Gruber-Vodicka, Harald R.; Dubilier, Nicole] Max Planck Inst Marine MicroBiol, Dept Symbiosis, Bremen, Germany; [Dannenberg, Richard P.] Epic, Madison, WI USA; [Osman, Eslam O.] Al Azhar Univ, Fac Sci, Marine Biol Dept, Cairo, Egypt","Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; Max Planck Society; Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Al Azhar University","Vohsen, SA (corresponding author), Penn State Univ, Dept Biol, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.","sav146@psu.edu","Dubilier, Nicole/I-8203-2018; Baums, Iliana/G-6435-2010; Gruber-Vodicka, Harald/AAD-2445-2020","Baums, Iliana/0000-0001-6463-7308; Gruber-Vodicka, Harald/0000-0001-5819-1549; Osman, Eslam/0000-0002-5517-8186","Gulf of Mexico Research Initiative; Max Planck Society; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Deep-sea Coral Research and Technology Program's Southeast Deep Coral Initiative (SEDCI); NOAA RESTORE Science Program [NA17NOS4510096]; National Science Foundation [OCE-1516763, OCE-1537959, BIO-OCE-1220478]; Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) [1435-01-05-CT-39187, M08PC20038]","Gulf of Mexico Research Initiative; Max Planck Society(Max Planck Society); National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Deep-sea Coral Research and Technology Program's Southeast Deep Coral Initiative (SEDCI)(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); NOAA RESTORE Science Program(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM)","This is contribution number 549 from the Ecosystem Impacts of Oil and Gas Inputs to the Gulf (ECOGIG) consortium.

In this study, we used metagenomic and metatranscriptomic data from the 2014 western Lake Erie cyanoHAB to explore the genetic diversity and biosynthetic potential of cyanobacteria belonging to the Anabaena, Dolichospermum, Aphanizomenon (ADA) clade. We reconstructed two near-complete metagenome-assembled genomes from two distinct ADA clade species, each containing biosynthetic gene clusters that encode novel and known secondary metabolites, including those with toxic and/or known taste and odor properties, that were transcriptionally active. However, neither ADA metagenome-assembled genome contained genes encoding guanitoxins, anatoxins, or saxitoxins, which are known to be produced by ADA.

Metabarcoding (i.e., large-scale taxonomic identification of complex samples via high-throughput sequencing of a DNA barcode region) frequently uses hypervariable regions of the nuclear eukaryotic 18S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene. However, species-level taxonomic identification is hampered by the conservative nature of the 18S gene in comparison to the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (COI) barcode gene. Additionally, metabarcoding relies on reference DNA sequence databases for classification of millions of unknown sequence reads and molecular operational taxonomic units (OTUs); databases that are at present depauperate for marine zooplankton taxa. Here, we characterized the mesozooplankton community for the Chukchi Borderland (CBL) region, western Arctic Ocean, through metabarcoding analysis of the V4 and V9 hypervariable regions of 18S rRNA and a portion of COI. Characterization of zooplankton diversity for the epipelagic and upper mesopelagic layers (0-500 m) was based upon 17 metazoan taxonomic categories encompassing 24 orders in 14 classes. Taxonomic classification using the V4 and V9 markers was most reliable for orders, with copepods dominating OTU counts. To increase taxonomic resolution and allow detection of species, V4, V9, and COI OTUs were classified against DNA sequence databases for the Arctic Ocean for the subclass Copepoda. The geographic region-specific databases for 18S rRNA and COI resulted in the detection and identification of 6 genera and 49 species of copepods representing 23 families, a marked increase in the taxonomic classification of the 18S rRNA markers. The greatest copepod species diversity was captured with V4 (34 species) followed by COI (28 species) with the least copepod diversity detected by V9 (5 species). Our results demonstrate the power of using multiple gene markers, with DNA reference databases that are specific to the geographic region of interest, providing more accurate metabarcoding biodiversity measures for the copepod assemblages compared to universal metazoan sequence reference databases. Results from this study highlight the need for continued DNA barcode sequencing to increase species representation in the reference sequence databases that are crucial for accurate characterization of mesozooplankton communities.","[Questel, Jennifer M.; Hopcroft, Russell R.; Smoot, Caitlin A.] Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Inst Marine Sci, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA; [DeHart, Hayley M.] George Washington Univ, Computat Biol Inst, Ashburn, VA USA; [Kosobokova, Ksenia N.] Russian Acad Sci, Shirshov Inst Oceanol, Moscow, Russia; [Bucklin, Ann] Univ Connecticut, Dept Marine Sci, Groton, CT 06340 USA","University of Alaska System; University of Alaska Fairbanks; George Washington University; Russian Academy of Sciences; Shirshov Institute of Oceanology; University of Connecticut","Questel, JM (corresponding author), Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Inst Marine Sci, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA.","jmquestel@alaska.edu","Questel, Jennifer/HKW-8698-2023; Kosobokova, Ksenia/P-3363-2014","Questel, Jennifer/0000-0003-0169-6102; Bucklin, Ann/0000-0003-3750-9348","NOAA Office of Exploration and Research under the Chukchi Borderlands: Exploration of Pelagic Life in a Complex Polar Environment project [NA15OAR0110209]; Russian Foundation for Basic Research [18-05-60158, 1904-00955]","NOAA Office of Exploration and Research under the Chukchi Borderlands: Exploration of Pelagic Life in a Complex Polar Environment project; Russian Foundation for Basic Research(Russian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR)Spanish Government)","This work was supported by the NOAA Office of Exploration and Research under the Chukchi Borderlands: Exploration of Pelagic Life in a Complex Polar Environment project NA15OAR0110209.

It contains 13 protein-coding genes, 2 ribosomal RNA genes and 21 tRNA genes with the same strand orientation as in other neogastropods. The tRNA gene for arginine was not identified in the mitogenome, although this amino acid is present in each of the proteins coded by the mitogenome. The mitochondrial gene order in C. richardi differs from that of all other neogastropods in having three translocations of tRNA genes, and two translocations of a tRNA gene and an adjacent protein coding gene. This is the first report of the translocation of protein-coding genes within the mitogenome of any neogastropod. Phylogenetic analyses show Coralliophilinae emerging either as a weakly supported sister taxon to the remaining subfamilies of Muricidae for which mitogenome data was available (ML), a result compatible with its former rank as family Coralliophilidae, or unresolved (BI) from the two clades containing these muricid subfamilies due to long branch bias generated by accelerated mutation rates within the coralliophiline mitogenome.

Infections originating from relatively cool waters in the northeast United States are typically rare, but recently, this region has shown an increase in infections attributed to the ecological introduction of pathogenic sequence type 36 (ST36) strains, which are endemic to the cool waters of the Pacific Northwest. A 2005 risk assessment performed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) modeled the postharvest growth of V. parahaemolyticus in oysters as a function of air temperature and the length of time the oysters remained unrefrigerated. This model, while useful, has raised questions about strain growth differences in oyster tissue and whether invasive pathogenic strains exhibit different growth rates than nonclinical strains, particularly at lower temperatures. To investigate this question, live eastern oysters were injected with ST36 clinical strains and non-ST36 nonclinical strains, and growth rates were measured using the most probable number (MPN) enumeration. The presence of V. parahaemolyticus was confirmed using PCR by targeting the thermolabile hemolysin gene (tlh), thermostable direct hemolysin (tdh), tdh-related hemolysin (trh), and a pathogenesis-related protein (prp). The growth rates of the ST36 strains were compared to the FDA model and several other data sets of V. parahaemolyticus growth in naturally inoculated oysters harvested from the Chesapeake Bay. Our data indicate that the growth rates from most studies fall within the mean of the FDA model, but with slightly higher growth at lower temperatures for ST36 strains injected into live oysters. These data suggest that further investigations of ST36 growth capability in oysters at temperatures previously thought unsuitably low for Vibrio growth are warranted.","[Ellett, Ava N.; Rosales, Detbra; Parveen, Salina] Univ Maryland Eastern Shore, Princess Anne, MD 21853 USA; [Ellett, Ava N.; Jacobs, John M.] NOAA, Natl Ctr Coastal Ocean Sci, Natl Ocean Serv, Oxford, MD 21654 USA; [Paranjpye, Rohinee] NOAA, Northwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Washington, DC USA","University System of Maryland; University of Maryland Eastern Shore; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; National Ocean Service, NOAA; National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science (NOOCS); National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA","Ellett, AN (corresponding author), Univ Maryland Eastern Shore, Princess Anne, MD 21853 USA.;Ellett, AN (corresponding author), NOAA, Natl Ctr Coastal Ocean Sci, Natl Ocean Serv, Oxford, MD 21654 USA.","ava.ellett@noaa.gov","","","National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration","National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA)","We thank the National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration for providing the funding for this work.",NA,39,3,3,0,5,"AMER SOC MICROBIOLOGY","WASHINGTON","1752 N ST NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036-2904 USA","2165-0497","","","MICROBIOL SPECTR","Microbiol.

The addition of H2O2 (8 mg/L) significantly reduced Cyanobacteria concentrations during a majority of experiments (66%; 6 of 9) and significantly increased eukaryotic green and unicellular brown algae in 78% and 45% of experiments, respectively. While heterotrophic bacteria declined significantly following H2O2 addition in all experiments, bacteria indicative of potential fecal contamination (Escherichia coli, Enterococcus, fecal coliform bacteria) consistently and significantly increased in response to H2O2, evidencing a form of 'pollution swapping'. H2O2 more effectively reduced Cyanobacteria in enclosed mesocosms compared to whole-ecosystem applications. Ten whole-pond H2O2 applications over a two-year period temporarily reduced cyanobacterial levels but never reduced concentrations below bloom thresholds and populations always rebounded in two weeks or less. The bacterial phyla of Cyanobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Planctomycetes were the most negatively impacted by H2O2. Microcystis was always reduced by H2O2, as was the toxin microcystin, but Microcystis remained dominant even after repeated H2O2 treatments. Although H2O2 favored the growth of eukaryotic algae over potentially harmful Cyanobacteria, the inability of H2O2 to end cyanobacterial blooms in this eutrophic water-body suggests it is a non-ideal mitigation approach in high biomass ecosystems and should be used judiciously due to potential negative impacts on non-target organisms and promotion of bacteria indicative of fecal contamination.

Here, we analyzed data produced by Restriction-Site Associated DNA Sequencing (RAD-Seq) of octocorals in the genus Paramuricea to elucidate diversification patterns and examine the role of environmental gradients in their evolution. The genus Paramuricea evolved around 8 MYA, with a high probability of a broad ancestral depth range from mesophotic depths to the deep sea. At around 1-2 MYA, the genus diversified across the continental slope of the deep North Atlantic, supporting the depth-differentiation hypothesis, with no invasions back into shallower depths (< 200 m). Diversification in the deep sea generally occurred from shallower, warmer waters to deeper, colder depths of the lower continental slope. We also found that the vertical structure of water masses was influential in shaping phylogeographic patterns across the North Atlantic Ocean, with clades found in either upper/intermediate or intermediate/deep water masses. Our data suggest that species diverged first because of environmental conditions, including depth, temperature, and/or water mass, and then diversified into different geographical regions multiple times. Our results highlight the role of the environment in driving the evolution and distribution of Paramuricea throughout the deep sea. Furthermore, our study supports prior work showing the utility of genomic approaches over the conventionally-used DNA barcodes in octocoral species delimitation.","[Quattrini, Andrea M.; Wirshing, Herman H.] Smithsonian Inst, Dept Invertebrate Zool, Natl Museum Nat Hist, Washington, DC USA; [Quattrini, Andrea M.; Adams, J.

From outcrops battered by waves, tidal pools, and periods of desiccations due to tides, these regions offer distinct environments and much of their cyanobacterial diversity remains unexplored. To help elucidate cyanobacteria from this habitat, one nostocalean cyanobacterium from Brittany, France was isolated and cultured. Typical morphological features including filaments with heteropolar trichomes, basal or intercalary heterocytes, false branching, and long hyaline apical hairs suggested the genus Nunduva. The combination of 16S rRNA gene and 16S-23S rRNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS), along with diagnosable morphological characteristics supports a distinct taxon from previously described species. Herein, the novel false branching cyanobacterium Nunduva sanctimaloensis sp. nov. is described along with its reproduction through modified monocytes.","[Berthold, David E.; Lefler, Forrest W.; Laughinghouse, I.

This study examines how tidal and diurnal forcings influence pelagic microorganisms and nutrient dynamics in 3 important and adjacent coastal biomes: mangroves, coral reefs, and seagrass meadows. We sampled for microbial (Bacteria and Archaea) community composition, cell abundances and environmental parameters at 9 coastal sites on St. John, US Virgin Islands that spanned 4 km in distance (4 coral reefs, 2 seagrass meadows and 3 mangrove locations within 2 larger bays). Eight samplings occurred over a 48 h period, capturing day and night microbial dynamics over 2 tidal cycles. The seagrass and reef biomes exhibited relatively consistent environmental conditions and microbial community structure but were dominated by shifts in picocyanobacterial abundances that were most likely attributed to diel dynamics. In contrast, mangrove ecosystems exhibited substantial daily shifts in environmental parameters, heterotrophic cell abundances and microbial community structure that were consistent with the tidal cycle. Differential abundance analysis of mangrove-associated microorganisms revealed enrichment of pelagic oligotrophic taxa during high tide and enrichment of putative sediment-associated microbes during low tide. Our study underpins the importance of tidal and diurnal time scales in structuring coastal microbial and nutrient dynamics, with diel and tidal cycles contributing to a highly dynamic microbial environment in mangroves, and time of day likely contributing to microbial dynamics in seagrass and reef biomes.","[Becker, Cynthia C.; Weber, Laura; Suca, Justin J.; Llopiz, Joel K.; Mooney, T.

Metagenome-assembled marker genes and genomes revealed a globally distributed novel HLII haplotype defined by adaptation to chronically low P conditions (HLII-P). Environmental correlation analysis revealed different factors were driving gene abundances verses phylogenetic differences. An analysis of cultured HLII genomes and metagenome-assembled genomes revealed a subclade within HLII, which corresponded to the novel HLII-P haplotype. This work represents the first global assessment of the HLII ecotype's phylogeography and corresponding functional differences.

Unraveling this co-evolutionary process has proven challenging because microbial partnerships are complex, and their assembly can be dynamic as well as scale- and taxon-dependent. Here, we monitored long-term experimental evolution of phytoplankton-bacteria interactions by reintroducing the intact microbiome into an axenized dinoflagellate Alexandrium tamarense to better understand microbiome assembly dynamics and how microbiome composition could shift and stabilize over 15 months. We examined host functioning by growth rate, photosynthetic capability, cell size, and other physiological signatures and compared it to associated microbial communities determined by 16S rRNA gene sequences. Our results showed that microbiome reconstitution did not restore the intact microbiome, instead a distinct microbial community shift to Roseobacter clade was observed in the re-established cultures. In-depth comparisons of microbial interactions revealed no apparent coupling between host physiology and specific bacterial taxa, indicating that highly represented, abundant taxa might not be essential for host functioning. The emergence of highly divergent Roseobacter clade sequences suggests fine-scale microbial dynamics driven by microdiversity could be potentially linked to host functioning. Collectively, our results indicate that functionally comparable microbiomes can be assembled from markedly different, highly diverse bacterial taxa in changing environments.","[Choi, Chang Jae; Jauzein, Cecile; Erdner, Deana L.] Univ Texas Austin, Marine Sci Inst, Port Aransas, TX 78373 USA; [Choi, Chang Jae] Univ Florida, Ft Lauderdale Res & Educ Ctr, Davie, FL USA; [Jauzein, Cecile] Ifremer, Dynam Ecosyst Cotiers DYNECO, Lab Ecol Pelag PELAGOS, Plouzane, France","University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; State University System of Florida; University of Florida; Ifremer","Choi, CJ (corresponding author), Univ Texas Austin, Marine Sci Inst, Port Aransas, TX 78373 USA.","changjae.choi@gmail.com","","Choi, Chang Jae/0000-0002-0831-7470","National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Center for Sponsored Coastal Ocean Research ECOHAB program [NA09NOS4780166, NA18NOS4780168]; University of Texas Marine Science Institute; ECOHAB [839]","National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Center for Sponsored Coastal Ocean Research ECOHAB program(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); University of Texas Marine Science Institute; ECOHAB","This research was made possible by a grant from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Center for Sponsored Coastal Ocean Research ECOHAB program under award no.

High-throughput sequencing offers a powerful alternative for examining population structure using many loci distributed across the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes. These single nucleotide polymorphisms are expected to provide finer scale and more accurate population level data; however, there have been few genomic studies applied to elasmobranch species. The desire to apply next-generation sequencing approaches is often tempered by the costs, which can be offset by pooling specimens prior to sequencing (pool-seq). In this study, we assess the utility of pool-seq by applying this method to the same individual silky sharks, Carcharhinus falciformis, previously surveyed with the mtDNA control region in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. Pool-seq methods were able to recover the entire mitochondrial genome as well as thousands of nuclear markers. This volume of sequence data enabled the detection of population structure between regions of the Atlantic Ocean populations, undetected in the previous study (inter-Atlantic mitochondrial SNPs FST values comparison ranging from 0.029 to 0.135 and nuclear SNPs from 0.015 to 0.025). Our results reinforce the conclusion that sampling the mitochondrial control region alone may fail to detect fine-scale population structure, and additional sampling across the genome may increase resolution for some species. Additionally, this study shows that the costs of analyzing 4,988 loci using pool-seq methods are equivalent to the standard Sanger-sequenced markers and become less expensive when large numbers of individuals (>300) are analyzed.","[Kraft, Derek W.; Conklin, Emily E.; Barba, Evan W.; Hutchinson, Melanie; Toonen, Robert J.; Forsman, Zac H.; Bowen, Brian W.] Univ Hawaii, Hawaii Inst Marine Biol, Kaneohe, HI 96744 USA; [Hutchinson, Melanie] Univ Hawaii, Joint Inst Marine & Atmospher Res, Pacific Isl Fisheries Sci Ctr, NOAA, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA","University of Hawaii System; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of Hawaii System","Kraft, DW (corresponding author), Univ Hawaii, Hawaii Inst Marine Biol, Kaneohe, HI 96744 USA.","Kraftd@hawaii.edu","Toonen, Rob/V-6230-2019; Forsman, Zac/F-1266-2015; Toonen, Robert J.

High levels of heterozygosity can result in genome mis-assemblies and a larger than expected genome size due to the haplotig versions of a single locus being assembled as separate loci. Here, we describe the first chromosome-level genome for the eastern oyster, Crassostrea virginica. Publicly released and annotated in 2017, the assembly has a scaffold N50 of 54 mb and is over 97.3% complete based on BUSCO analysis. The genome assembly for the eastern oyster is a critical resource for foundational research into molluscan adaptation to a changing environment and for selective breeding for the aquaculture industry. Subsequent resequencing data suggested the presence of haplotigs in the original assembly, and we developed a post hoc method to break up chimeric contigs and mask haplotigs in published heterozygous genomes and evaluated improvements to the accuracy of downstream analysis. Masking haplotigs had a large impact on SNP discovery and estimates of nucleotide diversity and had more subtle and nuanced effects on estimates of heterozygosity, population structure analysis, and outlier detection. We show that haplotig masking can be a powerful tool for improving genomic inference, and we present an open, reproducible resource for the masking of haplotigs in any published genome.","[Puritz, Jonathan B.] Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Biol Sci, Kingston, RI 02881 USA; [Guo, Ximing; He, Yan; Jin, Shubo; Liu, Ming] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Marine & Coastal Sci, Haskin Shellfish Res Lab, Port Norris, NJ USA; [Hare, Matthew; Zhao, Honggang] Cornell Univ, Dept Nat Resources & Environm, Ithaca, NY USA; [Hillier, LaDeana W.] Univ Washington, Dept Genome Sci, Seattle, WA USA; [Lotterhos, Katie E.] Northeastern Univ, Marine Sci Ctr, Dept Marine & Environm Sci, Nahant, MA USA; [Minx, Pat] Donald Danforth Plant Sci Ctr, Olivette, MO USA; [Modak, Tejashree] Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Cell & Mol Biol, Kingston, RI USA; [Proestou, Dina] ARS, USDA, Natl Cold Water Marine Aquaculture Ctr, Kingston, RI USA; [Rice, Edward S.] Univ Missouri, Bond Life Sci Ctr, Columbia, MO USA; [Tomlinson, Chad] Washington Univ, McDonnell Genome Inst, Sch Med, St Louis, MO USA; [Warren, Wesley C.] Univ Missouri, Inst Informat & Data Sci, Bond Life Sci Ctr, Dept Anim Sci & Surg, Columbia, MO USA; [Witkop, Erin; Gomez-Chiarri, Marta] Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Fisheries Anim & Vet Sci, Kingston, RI USA","University of Rhode Island; Rutgers University System; Rutgers University New Brunswick; Cornell University; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; Northeastern University; Donald Danforth Plant Science Center; University of Rhode Island; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia; Washington University (WUSTL); University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia; University of Rhode Island","Puritz, JB (corresponding author), Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Biol Sci, Kingston, RI 02881 USA.","jpuritz@uri.edu","; Puritz, Jonathan/C-9289-2011; Guo, Ximing/K-3804-2012","Lotterhos, Kathleen/0000-0001-7529-2771; Tomlinson, Chad/0000-0001-9905-6159; Gomez-Chiarri, Marta/0000-0002-2576-9612; Puritz, Jonathan/0000-0003-1404-4680; Guo, Ximing/0000-0002-6758-2709; Hare, Matthew/0000-0001-8569-8951","USDA NIFA AFRI [2015-67016-22942]; USDA-NIFA Hatch Program [1017848/RI0019-H020, 1021665/NJ30401]; NOAA [NA18NMF4720321]; Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission [NA18NMF4720321]","USDA NIFA AFRI(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)); USDA-NIFA Hatch Program; NOAA(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission","USDA NIFA AFRI, Grant/Award Number: 2015-67016-22942; USDA-NIFA Hatch Program, Grant/Award Number: 1017848/RI0019-H020 and 1021665/NJ30401; NOAA, Grant/Award Number: NA18NMF4720321; Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission, Grant/Award Number: NA18NMF4720321",NA,82,6,6,5,15,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","1755-098X","1755-0998","","MOL ECOL RESOUR","Mol.

To build upon a growing number of studies addressing high-light tolerance in K. brevis, specific photobiology and molecular mechanisms underlying this capacity were evaluated in culture. Since photosystem II (PSII) repair cycle activity can be crucial to high light tolerance in plants and algae, the present study assessed this capacity in K. brevis and characterized the ftsH-like genes which are fundamental to this process. Compared with cultures grown in low-light, cultures grown in high-light showed a 65-fold increase in PSII photoinactivation, a similar to 50-fold increase in PSII repair, enhanced non-photochemical quenching (NPQ), and depressed F-v/F-m. Repair rates were among the fastest reported in phytoplankton. Publicly available K. brevis transcriptomes (MMETSP) were queried for ftsH-like sequences and refined with additional sequencing from two K. brevis strains. The genes were phylogenetically related to haptophyte orthologs, implicating acquisition during tertiary endosymbiosis. RT-qPCR of three of the four ftsH-like homologs revealed that poly-A tails predominated in all homologs, and that the most highly expressed homolog had a 5' splice leader and amino-acid motifs characteristic of chloroplast targeting, indicating nuclear encoding for this plastid-targeted gene. High-light cultures showed a similar to 1.5-fold upregulation in mRNA expression of the thylakoid-associated genes. Overall, in conjunction with NPQ mechanisms, rapid PSII repair mediated by a haptophyte-derived ftsH prevents chronic photoinhibition in K. brevis. Our findings continue to build the case that high-light photobiology-supported by the acquisition and maintenance of tertiary endosymbiotic genes-is critical to the success of K. brevis in the Gulf of Mexico.","[Tilney, Charles L.; Hubbard, Katherine A.] Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservat Commiss, Fish & Wildlife Res Inst, St Petersburg, FL 33701 USA; [Tilney, Charles L.] Univ Quebec Rimouski, Inst Sci Mer Rimouski, Rimouski, PQ G5M 1L7, Canada","Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservation Commission; University of Quebec; Universite du Quebec a Rimouski","Tilney, CL (corresponding author), Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservat Commiss, Fish & Wildlife Res Inst, St Petersburg, FL 33701 USA.;Tilney, CL (corresponding author), Univ Quebec Rimouski, Inst Sci Mer Rimouski, Rimouski, PQ G5M 1L7, Canada.","tilnch01@uqar.ca","","","National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration [NA15NOS4780175]; State of Florida","National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); State of Florida","This work was supported in part by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration [NA15NOS4780175 to KAH) and the State of Florida [Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission?s Fish and Wildlife Research Institute, Harmful Algal Bloom Program] .",NA,159,1,1,2,18,"ELSEVIER","AMSTERDAM","RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","1568-9883","1878-1470","","HARMFUL ALGAE","Harmful Algae","OCT",2022,118,"",NA,"","","",NA,NA,"102295","10.1016/j.hal.2022.102295","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.hal.2022.102295",NA,"AUG 2022",14,"Marine & Freshwater Biology","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Marine & Freshwater Biology","4X7SR",36195421,"Bronze","","","2024-10-25","WOS:000861038000001","View Full Record in Web of Science",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, genetic and functional comparisons of free-living populations of symbionts to their host-associated counterparts are sparse. Here, we assembled the first genomes of the chemoautotrophic gammaproteobacterial symbionts affiliated with the deep-sea snail Alviniconcha hessleri from two separate hydrothermal vent fields of the Mariana Back-Arc Basin. We used phylogenomic and population genomic methods to assess sequence and gene content variation between free-living and host-associated symbionts.Results Our phylogenomic analyses show that the free-living and host-associated symbionts of A. hessleri from both vent fields are populations of monophyletic strains from a single species. Furthermore, genetic structure and gene content analyses indicate that these symbiont populations are differentiated by vent field rather than by lifestyle.Conclusion Together, this work suggests that, despite the potential influence of host-mediated acquisition and release processes on horizontally transmitted symbionts, geographic isolation and/or adaptation to local habitat conditions are important determinants of symbiont population structure and intra-host composition.","[Hauer, Michelle A.

The GC-MS analysis showed that the concentration of floridoside and isofloridoside did not change in response to desiccation as expected of compatible solutes. Genes involved in the synthesis of (iso)floridoside and trehalose were identified from the recently completedPorphyragenome, including four putative trehalose-6-phosphate synthase (TPS) genes, two putative trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase (TPP) genes, and one putative trehalose synthase/amylase (TreS) gene.

Globally, Gymnura altavela is considered endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Our study analyzed the complete mitochondrial genome of G. altavela sequenced from an individual captured in the western Atlantic and compared it with a mitochondrial genome from a conspecific collected in the Mediterranean to explore if G. altavela comprises cryptic species. The newly assembled mitochondrial genome of G. altavela is 19,361bp in length and has 13 protein-coding genes (PCGs), two ribosomal RNA genes (12s ribosomal RNA and 16s ribosomal RNA), 22 transfer RNA (tRNA) genes, and a 3,659 bp control region. The gene order is identical to that reported for the specimen collected in the Mediterranean and that of the congeneric Long-tailed Butterfly Ray, G. poecilura. A phylomitogenomic analysis based on translated PCGs supported the monophyly of the genus Gymnura and indicated that genetic dissimilarity between G. altavela from the western Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea was greater than that calculated among congeneric species belonging to the genera Mobula and Neotrygon, similar to that calculated among congeneric stingrays in the genus Hemitrygon, but lower than that calculated among congeneric species in the genera Pateobatis and Urogymnus. Overall, our comparisons suggest that G. altavela comprises cryptic species or at least indicates considerable genetic structure between populations in the western Atlantic and Mediterranean. We present these findings in a phylomitogenomic analysis of other Myliobatiformes and Rhinopristiformes. Additional phylogeographic and taxonomic studies of G. altavela are needed to support conservation efforts for this endangered ray that may comprise cryptic evolutionary units.","[Cady, Tabitha; Baeza, J.

The 'Porites lobata species complex' consists of branching and mounding corals that form reefs across the Pacific. We used reduced representation meta-genomic sequencing to examine genetic relationships within this species complex and to identify candidate loci associated with colony morphology, cryptic genetic structure, and apparent bleaching susceptibility. We compared existing Porites data with bleached and unbleached colonies of the branching coral P. compressa collected in Kaneohe Bay Hawai'i during the 2015 coral bleaching event. Loci that mapped to coral, symbiont, and microbial references revealed genetic structure consistent with recent host-symbiont co-evolution. Cryptic genetic clades were resolved that previous work has associated with distance from shore, but no genetic structure was associated with bleaching. We identified many candidate loci associated with morphospecies, including candidate host and symbiont loci with fixed differences between branching and mounding corals. We also found many loci associated with cryptic genetic structure, yet relatively few loci associated with bleaching. Recent host-symbiont co-evolution and rapid diversification suggests that variation and therefore the capacity of these corals to adapt may be underappreciated.","[Orsman, Z. H. F.; Knapp, I. S.

Chondrus ocellatus Holmes was reported from Hawai'i Island (19 degrees N latitude) in 1999 as a new record based on vegetative and tetrasporangial characteristics. The first specimens were collected by Setchell in 1900 in Hilo, HI. The presence of a Chondrus species in the subtropics has been a phycological enigma for over 100 years. We addressed the question of species identity and biogeographic affinities of the Hawaiian Chondrus with fresh cystocarpic material, DNA samples, and phylogenetic analyses. Analysis and comparison of five genes (nuclear: EF2; plastid: psbA, rbcL, and 23S/UPA; mitochondrial: COI) from Hawaiian Chondrus and holotype and topotype material of 10 of the 11 accepted Chondrus species indicate that Hawaiian specimens are C. retortus Matsumoto et Shimada. However, unlike type material, the Hawaiian specimens are commonly pinnulate, vary significantly in secondary medullary filament density, and have mature cystocarps filling the entire medullary space. This study shows the value of using multi-gene loci and comparing multiple sequences of several species to confirm taxonomic conclusions. Our findings suggest that C. retortus may have immigrated via rafting on natural floating material or on ships' hulls. Solving this old puzzle adds new insight into Hawaiian phytogeography.","[Veillet, Anne] ARS, USDA, Daniel K Inouye US Pacific Basin Agr Res Ctr, 64 Nowelo St, Hilo, HI 96720 USA; [Kittle, Ronald P.; Schmidt, William E.; Fredericq, Suzanne] Univ Louisiana, Biol Dept, 410 E St Mary Blvd Billeaud Hall Room 108, Lafayette, LA 70503 USA; [Veillet, Anne; McDermid, Karla J.] Univ Hawaiiat, Marine Sci Dept, 200 W Kawili St, Hilo, HI 96720 USA","United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); University of Louisiana Lafayette","Kittle, RP (corresponding author), Univ Louisiana, Biol Dept, 410 E St Mary Blvd Billeaud Hall Room 108, Lafayette, LA 70503 USA.;McDermid, KJ (corresponding author), Univ Hawaiiat, Marine Sci Dept, 200 W Kawili St, Hilo, HI 96720 USA.","ronaldkittleull@gmail.com; mcdermid@hawaii.edu","","","NSF [DEB-1754504]; NOAA/Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission [NA18NMF4720007]; University of Louisiana at Lafayette Graduate Student Organization","NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NOAA/Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission; University of Louisiana at Lafayette Graduate Student Organization","We greatly appreciate the support from NSF research grant DEB-1754504 and NOAA/Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission NOAA Award NA18NMF4720007.

We used comparative genomics and temperature growth experiments of bacteria from the family Colwelliaceae to identify genomic factors correlated with optimal growth temperature (OGT). A phylogenomic analysis of 67 public and 39 newly sequenced strains revealed three main clades of Colwelliaceae. Temperature growth experiments revealed significant differences in mean OGT by clade, wherein strains of Colwelliaceae had similar growth rates at -1 degrees C but varied in their ability to tolerate 17 degrees C. Using amino acid compositional indices, a multiple linear regression model was constructed to predict the OGT of these organisms (RMSE 5.2 degrees C). Investigation of Colwelliaceae functional genes revealed a putative cold-adaptive gene cassette that was present in psychrophilic strains but absent in a closely related strain with a significantly higher OGT. This study also presents genomic evidence suggesting that the clade of Colwelliaceae containing Colwellia hornerae should be investigated as a new genus.

Changes in this chemical pool serve as invisible signals of overall ecosystem health and disruption to this finely tuned equilibrium. In coral reefs, the scope and magnitude of the chemicals involved in maintaining reef equilibria are largely unknown. Processes involving small, polar molecules, which form the majority components of labile dissolved organic carbon, are often poorly captured using traditional techniques. We employed chemical derivatization with mass spectrometry-based targeted exometabolomics to quantify polar dissolved phase metabolites on five coral reefs in the U.S. Virgin Islands. We quantified 45 polar exometabolites, demonstrated their spatial variability, and contextualized these findings in terms of geographic and benthic cover differences. By comparing our results to previously published coral reef exometabolomes, we show the novel quantification of 23 metabolites, including central carbon metabolism compounds (e.g., glutamate) and novel metabolites such as homoserine betaine. We highlight the immense potential of chemical derivatization-based exometabolomics for quantifying labile chemical cues on coral reefs and measuring molecular level responses to environmental stressors. Overall, improving our understanding of the composition and dynamics of reef exometabolites is vital for effective ecosystem monitoring and management strategies.","[Garcia, Brianna M.; Becker, Cynthia C.; Weber, Laura; Swarr, Gretchen J.; Soule, Melissa C.

Reef building corals present a good model for studying phenotypic plasticity because they have experienced rapid climate-driven declines in recent decades (within a single generation of many corals), often with differential survival among individuals during heat stress. Underlying differences in thermotolerance may be driven by differences in baseline levels of environmental stress, including pollution stress. To examine this possibility, acute heat stress experiments were conducted on Acropora hyacinthus from 10 sites around Tutuila, American Samoa with differing nutrient pollution impact. A threshold-based heat stress assay was conducted in 2014 and a ramp-hold based assay was conducted in 2019. Bleaching responses were measured by assessing color paling. Endosymbiont community composition was assessed at each site using quantitative PCR. RNA sequencing was used to compare differences in coral gene expression patterns prior to and during heat stress in 2019. In 2014, thermotolerance varied among sites, with polluted sites holding more thermotolerant corals. These differences in thermotolerance correlated with differences in symbiont communities, with higher proportions of heat-tolerant Durusdinium found in more polluted sites. By 2019, thermotolerance varied less among sites, with no clear trend by pollution level. This coincided with a shift toward Durusdinium across all sites, reducing symbiont community differences seen in 2014. While pollution and symbiont community no longer could explain variation in thermotolerance by 2019, gene expression patterns at baseline levels could be used to predict thermotolerance thresholds. These patterns suggest that the mechanisms underlying thermotolerance shifted between 2014 and 2019, though it is possible trends may have also been affected by methodological differences between heat stress assays. This study documents a shift in symbiont community over time and captures potential implications of that shift, including how it affects variation in thermotolerance among neighboring reefs. This work also highlights how gene expression patterns could help identify heat-tolerant corals in a future where most corals are dominated by Durusdinium and symbiont-driven thermotolerance has reached an upper limit.","[Naugle, Melissa S.; Logan, Cheryl A.] Calif State Univ, Dept Marine Sci, Seaside, CA 93955 USA; [Naugle, Melissa S.] Moss Landing Marine Labs, Moss Landing, CA 95039 USA; [Oliver, Thomas A.] NOAA, Pacific Isl Fisheries Sci Ctr, Honolulu, HI USA; [Barshis, Daniel J.] Old Dominion Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Norfolk, VA USA; [Gates, Ruth D.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Hawai Inst Marine Biol, Kaneohe, HI USA","Moss Landing Marine Laboratories; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Old Dominion University; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa","Naugle, MS (corresponding author), Calif State Univ, Dept Marine Sci, Seaside, CA 93955 USA.;Naugle, MS (corresponding author), Moss Landing Marine Labs, Moss Landing, CA 95039 USA.","mnaugle@csumb.edu","Oliver, Tom/A-6432-2012; Logan, Cheryl/AAU-3609-2021; Naugle, Melissa/GPX-3927-2022","Naugle, Melissa/0000-0003-4127-5150; Logan, Cheryl/0000-0001-7639-4956","National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Coral Reef Conservation Program [NA13NOS4820018]; California State University, Monterey Bay Research, Scholarship and Creative Activity grant; Earl H. and Ethel M.

Characterizing population structure is important for the effective management of exploited species, as it can be used to identify appropriate scales of management in fishery and aquaculture contexts. The California sea cucumber, Apostichopus californicus, is one such exploited species whose management could benefit from further characterization of population structure. Using restriction site-associated DNA (RAD) sequencing, we developed 2075 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to quantify genetic structure over a broad section of the species' range along the North American west coast and within the Salish Sea, a region supporting the Washington State A. californicus fishery and developing aquaculture production of the species. We found evidence for population structure (global fixation index (F-ST) = 0.0068) with limited dispersal driving two patterns of differentiation: isolation-by-distance and a latitudinal gradient of differentiation. Notably, we found detectable population differences among collection sites within the Salish Sea (pairwise F-ST = 0.001-0.006). Using F-ST outlier detection and gene-environment association, we identified 10.2% of total SNPs as putatively adaptive. Environmental variables (e.g., temperature, salinity) from the sea surface were more correlated with genetic variation than those same variables measured near the benthos, suggesting that selection on pelagic larvae may drive adaptive differentiation to a greater degree than selection on adults. Our results were consistent with previous estimates of and patterns in population structure for this species in other extents of the range. Additionally, we found that patterns of neutral and adaptive differentiation co-varied, suggesting that adaptive barriers may limit dispersal. Our study provides guidance to decision-makers regarding the designation of management units for A. californicus and adds to the growing body of literature identifying genetic population differentiation in marine species despite large, nominally connected populations.","[Lowell, Natalie; Tarpey, Carolyn; May, Samuel; Hauser, Lorenz] Univ Washington, Sch Aquat & Fishery Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Suhrbier, Andy] Pacific Shellfish Inst, Olympia, WA USA; [Carson, Henry] Washington Dept Fish & Wildlife, Olympia, WA USA","University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; Washington Department of Fish & Wildlife (WDFW)","Lowell, N (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Sch Aquat & Fishery Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.","nclowell@uw.edu","Hauser, Lorenz/E-4365-2010; May, Samuel/GVS-9049-2022","May, Samuel/0000-0002-5312-140X","NOAA Saltonstall-Kennedy program [NA15NMF4270322]; Washington Sea Grant, University of Washington, pursuant to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration [NA17OAR4170223, R/SFA/N-5]; National Marine Fisheries Service-Sea Grant Joint Fellowship [NA17OAR4170241]","NOAA Saltonstall-Kennedy program; Washington Sea Grant, University of Washington, pursuant to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration; National Marine Fisheries Service-Sea Grant Joint Fellowship","This work was supported by the NOAA Saltonstall-Kennedy program (#NA15NMF4270322, awarded to LH; https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/grant/saltonstall-kennedy-grant-competition), by a grant from Washington Sea Grant, University of Washington, pursuant to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (# NA17OAR4170223, R/SFA/N-5, awarded to LH; https://wsg.washington.edu/research/26155-2-15/), and a National Marine Fisheries Service-Sea Grant Joint Fellowship (#NA17OAR4170241, awarded to NL; https://seagrant.noaa.gov/NMFS-SG-Fellowship).

This harmful aquatic invasive species is a predatory freshwater fish native to northeastern Asia that, following deliberate introduction, has established itself in multiple water basins in the eastern United States, as well as expanding its range into the Midwest. Previous work assessed the population structure and estimated the long-term effective population sizes of the populations present in the United States, but the source of the initial introduction(s) to the U.S. remains unidentified. Building on earlier work, we used whole genome scans (2b-RAD genomic sequencing) to analyze single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from C. argus to screen the genomes of these invasive fish from United States waters and from three sites in their native range in China. We recovered 2,822 SNP loci from genomic DNA extracted from 164 fish sampled from the eastern United States and Arkansas (Mississippi River basin), plus 30 fish sampled from three regions of the Yangtze River basin in China (n = 10 individuals per basin). Our results provide evidence supporting the Yangtze River basin in China, specifically the Bohu and/or Liangzi lakes, is a likely source of the C. argus introductions in multiple regions of the U.S., including the Lower Hudson River basin, Upper Hudson River basin and Philadelphia (Lower Delaware River basin). This information, in conjunction with additional sampling from the native range, will help to determine the source(s) of introduction for the other U.S. populations. Additionally, this work will provide valuable information for management to help prevent and manage future introductions into United States waterways, as well as aid in the development of more targeted strategies to regulate established populations and inhibit further spread.","[Resh, Carlee A.; Benesh, Kasey C.; Mahon, Andrew R.] Cent Michigan Univ, Dept Biol, Mt Pleasant, MI 48859 USA; [Galaska, Matthew P.] Univ Washington, Cooperat Inst Climate Ocean & Ecosyst Studies, Seattle, WA USA; [Galaska, Matthew P.] Pacific Marine Environm Lab, Natl Ocean & Atmospher Adm, Seattle, WA USA; [Gardner, Jonathan P.

Genomic resources to support conservation of this species are needed. Here, we assembled, annotated and characterised in detail the mitochondrial genome of O. chrysurus. The mitochondrial genome of O. chrysurus is 16,502 bp in length and encodes 13 protein-coding genes (PCGs), 22 transfer RNA genes (tRNA), and two ribosomal RNA genes (rRNA). The putative control region, 827 bp in length, is located between the tRNA P and tRNA F genes. Most genes are encoded on the positive strand, while a single PCG (nad6) and six tRNA genes (in order from 5 ' to 3 ': tRNA N, tRNA P, tRNA E, tRNA Q, tRNA C and tRNA Y) are encoded on the negative strand. All tRNA have a typical 'cloverleaf' secondary structure except tRNA S1 (Serine1) that lacks the D arm. Calculated Ka/Ks values of all PCGs were <1, suggesting that these genes are under purifying selection. A maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenetic analysis confirmed monophyly of the family Lutjanidae and indicated that the genus Lutjanus is paraphyletic given that O. chrysurus clustered together with Lutjanus peru and L. guttatus in a strongly supported clade.

Strikingly, corals from the two nearshore sites with higher levels of environmental stressors on different islands over 100 km apart with similar environmentally stressful conditions were genetically closer (F-ST = 0.0, P = 0.73) than those within a single location less than 2 km apart (F-ST = 0.04 similar to 0.08, P < 0.01). In contrast, a third site with a less impacted nearshore site (i.e., less pronounced environmental gradient) showed no significant structure from the offshore comparison. Our results show much stronger support for environment than distance separating these populations. Our finding suggests that ecological boundaries from human impacts may play a role in forming genetic structure in the coastal environment, and that genetic divergence in the absence of geographical barriers to gene flow might be explained by selective pressure across contrasting habitats.","[Tisthammer, Kaho H.; Richmond, Robert H.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Kewalo Marine Lab, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Tisthammer, Kaho H.] San Francisco State Univ, Dept Biol, San Francisco, CA 94132 USA; [Forsman, Zac H.; Toonen, Robert J.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Hawaii Inst Marine Biol, Kaneohe, HI 96744 USA","University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; California State University System; San Francisco State University; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa","Tisthammer, KH (corresponding author), Univ Hawaii Manoa, Kewalo Marine Lab, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.;Tisthammer, KH (corresponding author), San Francisco State Univ, Dept Biol, San Francisco, CA 94132 USA.;Toonen, RJ (corresponding author), Univ Hawaii Manoa, Hawaii Inst Marine Biol, Kaneohe, HI 96744 USA.","ktist@sfsu.edu; rjtoonen@gmail.com","Richmond, Robert/G-1385-2014; Forsman, Zac/F-1266-2015; Toonen, Rob/V-6230-2019","Tisthammer, Kaho/0000-0002-4530-4572","National Fish and Wildlife Foundation [34413]; Hawaii Department of Health [MOA 13-502]; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Coral Reef Ecosystem Studies Program [NA17NMF4520144]; Seaver Institute; NSF-OA [1416889]","National Fish and Wildlife Foundation; Hawaii Department of Health; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Coral Reef Ecosystem Studies Program(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); Seaver Institute; NSF-OA","Financial support came from the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation (Grant Number 34413), the Hawaii Department of Health (MOA 13-502), and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Coral Reef Ecosystem Studies Program (NA17NMF4520144) to Robert H.

Several biosynthetic gene clusters are conserved in T. turnerae and their host shipworms around the world, implying that they encode defensive compounds. Here, we describe turnercyclamycins, lipopeptide antibiotics encoded in the genomes of all sequenced T. turnerae strains. Turnercyclamycins are bactericidal against challenging Gram-negative pathogens, including colistin-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii. Phenotypic screening identified the outer membrane as the likely target. Turnercyclamycins and colistin operate by similar cellular, although not necessarily molecular, mechanisms, but turnercyclamycins kill colistin-resistant A. baumannii, potentially filling an urgent clinical need. Thus, by exploring environments that select for the properties we require, we harvested the fruits of evolution to discover compounds with potential to target unmet health needs.

The demand for highly prized shark commodities continues to fuel the international trade and gives fisheries incentive to use these resources, which have a low intrinsic capability to recover. Recognising the ur-gency for regulation, many countries voted to include more shark and ray species in the Appendices of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). However, the identification of fins in fisheries landings before they enter international trade is a major limitation for CITES compliance. This study reports the current performance of the iSharkFin system, a machine learning technology which aims to allow users to identify the species of a wet shark dorsal fin from its image. Photographs of 1147 wet dorsal fins from 39 shark species, collected in 12 countries, were used to train the algorithm over a four-year period. As new cohorts of images were used to test the performance of the learning algorithm, the accuracy of species assignments of known specimens was variable but did increase, reaching 85.3% and 59.1% at genus and species level respectively. The accuracy in predicting CITES-listed sharks versus unlisted sharks was 94.0% based on the 39 species currently represented in the baseline. Our results suggest that if supplied with high data inputs for specific fisheries assemblages and accompanied by user training, iSharkFin has promise for site-specific development as a rapid field identification tool in fisheries monitoring, and as a screening tool alongside traditional field morphology to detect potential CITES specimens for fisheries compliance and enforcement.","[Barone, Monica] Food & Agr Org United Nations, Viale Terme Caracalla, I-00153 Rome, Italy; [Mollen, Frederik H.] Elasmobranch Res, Rehaegenstr 4, B-2820 Bonheiden, Belgium; [Giles, Jenny L.] Fin Forens, 1145 10th Ave 322, Seattle, WA 98102 USA; [Marshall, Lindsay J.] Stick Figure Fish Illustrat, 22 Lancewood Ave, Peregian Beach, Qld 4573, Australia; [Villate-Moreno, Melany] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Dept Biol 2, Aquat Ecol, Grosshaderner Str 2, D-82152 Munich, Germany; [Mazzoldi, Carlotta] Univ Padua, Dept Biol, Viale G Colombo 3, I-35131 Padua, Italy; [Perez-Costas, Elisa; Heine, Jurgen; Guisande, Castor] Univ Vigo, Dept Ecol & Biol Anim, Campus Univ Vigo, Vigo 36310, Pontevedra, Spain","Food & Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO); University of Munich; University of Padua; Universidade de Vigo","Barone, M (corresponding author), Food & Agr Org United Nations, Viale Terme Caracalla, I-00153 Rome, Italy.","monica.barone@fao.org","Marshall, Lindsay/B-5179-2013; Mazzoldi, Carlotta/AAU-8628-2020; Mollen, Frederik/AAG-7965-2020","Mollen, Frederik H./0000-0002-9934-1029; MAZZOLDI, CARLOTTA/0000-0002-2798-3030","European Union [EP/INT/227/UEP]; Government of Japan [GCP/INT/228/JPN]; Government of the United States of America; Government of the United States of America, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) -FAO collaborative Trust Fund project Cooperative Agreement on the United States of America Support for Fisheries and Aquaculture Department Activities [GCP/GLO/576/USA]","European Union(European Union (EU)); Government of Japan; Government of the United States of America; Government of the United States of America, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) -FAO collaborative Trust Fund project Cooperative Agreement on the United States of America Support for Fisheries and Aquaculture Department Activities","This work was supported by the European Union Cooperation between FAO and CITES supporting shark and ray fishery management (EP/INT/227/UEP), the Government of Japan Improved fisheries management for sustainable use of marine living resources in the face of changing systems (GCP/INT/228/JPN), and by the Government of the United States of America, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) -FAO collaborative Trust Fund project Cooperative Agreement on the United States of America Support for Fisheries and Aquaculture Department Activities (GCP/GLO/576/USA).

Consequent mortality and thermal stress were observed in Kane'ohe Bay (O'ahu). The two most dominant local species exhibited a phenotypic dichotomy of either bleaching resistance or susceptibility (Montipora capitata and Porites compressa), while the third predominant species (Pocillopora acuta) was broadly susceptible to bleaching. In order to survey shifts in coral microbiomes during bleaching and recovery, 50 colonies were tagged and periodically monitored. Metabarcoding of three genetic markers (16S rRNA gene ITS1 and ITS2) followed by compositional approaches for community structure analysis, differential abundance and correlations for longitudinal data were used to temporally compare Bacteria/Archaea, Fungi and Symbiodiniaceae dynamics. P. compressa corals recovered faster than P. acuta and Montipora capitata. Prokaryotic and algal communities were majorly shaped by host species, and had no apparent pattern of temporal acclimatization. Symbiodiniaceae signatures were identified at the colony scale, and were often related to bleaching susceptibility. Bacterial compositions were practically constant between bleaching phenotypes, and more diverse in P. acuta and M. capitata. P. compressa's prokaryotic community was dominated by a single bacterium. Compositional approaches (via microbial balances) allowed the identification of fine-scale differences in the abundance of a consortium of microbes, driving changes by bleaching susceptibility and time across all hosts. The three major coral reef founder-species in Kane'ohe Bay revealed different phenotypic and microbiome responses after 2014-2015 heatwaves. It is difficult to forecast, a more successful strategy towards future scenarios of global warming. Differentially abundant microbial taxa across time and/or bleaching susceptibility were broadly shared among all hosts, suggesting that locally, the same microbes may modulate stress responses in sympatric coral species. Our study highlights the potential of investigating microbial balances to identify fine-scale microbiome changes, serving as local diagnostic tools of coral reef fitness.","[Nunez-Pons, Laura] Dept Integrat Marine Ecol EMI, Stn Zool Anton Dohrn, Villa Comunale, I-80121 Naples, Italy; [Nunez-Pons, Laura] Natl Biodivers Future Ctr, NBFC, I-90133 Palermo, Italy; [Cunning, Ross] John G Shedd Aquarium, Daniel P Haerther Ctr Conservat & Res, 1200 South Lake Shore Dr, Chicago, IL 60605 USA; [Nelson, Craig E.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Oceanog & Sea Grant Coll Program, Daniel K Inouye Ctr Microbial Oceanography Res, Honolulu, HI USA; [Amend, Anthony S.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Pacifi Biosci Res Ctr, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Sogin, Maggie] Univ Calif Merced, Mol & Cell Biol, Merced, CA USA; [Gates, Ruth] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Hawai Inst Marine Biol, Honolulu, HI USA; [Ritson-Williams, Raphael] Santa Clara Univ, Coll Arts & Sci, 500 Camino Real, Santa Clara, CA 95053 USA","Stazione Zoologica Anton Dohrn di Napoli; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; University of California System; University of California Merced; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; Santa Clara University","Nuez-Pons, L (corresponding author), Dept Integrat Marine Ecol EMI, Stn Zool Anton Dohrn, Villa Comunale, I-80121 Naples, Italy.","laura.nunezpons@szn.it; rcunning@sheddaquarium.org; craig.nelson@hawaii.edu; amend@hawaii.edu; esogin@ucmerced.edu; rgates@hawaii.edu; rritson-williams@calacademy.org","Nelson, Craig/H-3323-2019","","Experiment.com all-or-nothing crowdfunding platform; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Project - University of Hawaii Sea Grant College Program [A/AS-1]; SOEST, under Institutional Grant from NOAA Office of Sea Grant, Department of Commerce [NA22OAR4170108]; UH Sea Grant [UNIHI-SEAGRANT-JC-22-10]","Experiment.com all-or-nothing crowdfunding platform; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Project - University of Hawaii Sea Grant College Program(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); SOEST, under Institutional Grant from NOAA Office of Sea Grant, Department of Commerce(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); UH Sea Grant","& nbsp;Thanks are due to C.

In the southeastern US, the common bottlenose dolphin Tursiops truncatus is the predominant marine mammal in coastal waters, but its role as a top predator has received little attention. Diet studies of piscivorous predators, like bottlenose dolphins, start with assessing prey otoliths recovered from stomachs or feces, but digestive erosion hampers species identification and underestimates fish weight (FW). To compensate, FW is often estimated from the least affected otoliths and scaled to other otoliths, which also introduces bias. The sulcus, an otolith surface feature, has a species-specific shape of its ostium and caudal extents, which is within the otolith edge for some species. We explored whether the sulcus could improve species identification and estimation of prey size using a case study of four sciaenid species targeted by fisheries and bottlenose dolphins in North Carolina. Methods were assessed first on otoliths from a reference collection (n = 421) and applied to prey otoliths (n = 5,308) recovered from 120 stomachs of dead stranded dolphins. We demonstrated in reference-collection otoliths that cauda to sulcus length (CL:SL) could discriminate between spotted seatrout (Cynoscion nebulosus) and weakfish (Cynoscion regalis) (classification accuracy = 0.98). This method confirmed for the first time predation of spotted seatrout by bottlenose dolphins in North Carolina. Using predictive models developed from reference-collection otoliths, we provided evidence that digestion affects otolith length more than sulcus or cauda length, making the latter better predictors. Lastly, we explored scenarios of calculating total consumed biomass across degrees of digestion. A suggested approach was for the least digested otoliths to be scaled to other otoliths iteratively from within the same stomach, month, or season as samples allow. Using the otolith sulcus helped overcome challenges of species identification and fish size estimation, indicating their potential use in other diet studies.","[Byrd, Barbie L.] NOAA, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Southeast Fisheries Sci Ctr, Beaufort, NC USA; [Hohn, Aleta A.] NOAA, NMFS, Southeast Fisheries Sci Ctr, Beaufort, NC USA; [Krause, Jacob R.] North Carolina State Univ, Dept Appl Ecol, Ctr Marine Sci & Technol, Morehead City, NC USA","National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; North Carolina State University","Byrd, BL (corresponding author), North Carolina Div Marine Fisheries, 3441 Arendell St, Morehead City, NC 28557 USA.","barbie.byrd@ncdenr.gov","Hohn, Aleta/G-2888-2011","Hohn, Aleta/0000-0002-9992-7062; Krause, Jacob/0000-0002-9804-2481","","","",NA,77,7,8,2,14,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","2045-7758","","","ECOL EVOL","Ecol.

However, we have limited understanding of how often it occurs in variable environments. Whether phenotypic plasticity can evolve in distinct ways among populations experiencing different patterns of abiotic variability is unclear. Abiotic conditions in coastal marine habitats can be highly heterogeneous at small spatial scales, which might promote local adaptation. The harpacticoid copepod Tigriopus californicus (Baker, 1912) has become a model system for testing whether phenotypic differences among populations are a result of local adaptation. To identify potential selective pressures in the field, temperature and salinity were measured in high shore pools for six months at three sites on San Juan Island in Washington, USA. A common garden experiment with factorial combinations of seven temperature and two salinity (32, 55 ppt) treatments was conducted on these distinct populations. Two temperature treatments varied daily, both with an average of 20 C, but different ranges (low amplitude: 15-25 C, high amplitude: 10-30 C). The other five treatments were the average, maximum, and minimum temperatures held constant. Fecundity, survivorship, and development were characterized across two generations. There were strong interactive effects of temperature and hypersalinity on copepod culture dynamics, but these effects differed among populations. Abiotic patterns in the field were correlated with few observed differences in population phenotypes, thus limited evidence for local adaptation was found. For these populations, differences in selective pressures among sites might not be strong enough to overcome the influence of genetic drift.","[Liguori, Alyssa] SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Ecol & Evolut, 650 Life Sci Bldg, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; [Liguori, Alyssa] Josephine Bay Paul Ctr Comparat Mol Biol & Evolut, Marine Biol Lab, 7 MBL St, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA","State University of New York (SUNY) System; Stony Brook University; Marine Biological Laboratory - Woods Hole","Liguori, A (corresponding author), Josephine Bay Paul Ctr Comparat Mol Biol & Evolut, Marine Biol Lab, 7 MBL St, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.","alyssa.liguori@stonybrook.edu","","Liguori, Alyssa/0000-0002-5645-6096","FHL Research Fellowship Endowment; Patricia L.

Nine polymorphic microsatellite loci were analyzed to characterize contemporary population structure and gene flow as well as historical migration rates of Montastraea cavernosa at five sites off Martin, Palm Beach, and Broward counties in southeast Florida. The sampled populations demonstrated evidence of genetic isolation by distance over a geographic range of 85 km. Population genetic structure was divided into two genetic clusters, northern and southern, with admixture along a latitudinal gradient. Historical migration models indicated likely panmixia throughout all sites sampled, identifying a potential reduction in connectivity among the sampled populations through time. Though M. cavernosa populations demonstrated evidence of historical connectivity, contemporary patterns of isolation by distance suggest that effective management will require localized actions to maximize the likelihood of sustaining individual populations in the northern FRT. Given the results of this study, coupled with recent coral mortality events in the region, we recommend regional conservation efforts and management initiatives throughout southeast Florida within a more comprehensive FRT-wide management network.","[Dodge, D.

Accurate environmental impact assessment is critical to the effective management of a new industry and depends on a sound understanding of species taxonomy, biogeography, and connectivity across a range of scales. Connectivity is a particularly important parameter in determining ecosystem resilience, as it helps to define the ability of a system to recover post-impact. Scavenging amphipods in the superfamilies Alicelloidea Lowry and De Broyer, 2008 and Lysianassoidea Dana, 1849 contribute to a unique and abundant scavenging community in abyssal ecosystems. They are relatively easy to sample and in recent years have become the target of several molecular and taxonomic studies, but are poorly studied in the CCZ. Here, a molecular approach is used to identify and delimit species, and to investigate evolutionary relationships of scavenging amphipods from both abyssal plain and deep (>3000 m) seamount habitats in three APEIs (Areas of Particular Environmental Interest, i.e., designated conservation areas) in the western CCZ. A total of 17 different morphospecies of scavenging amphipods were identified, which include at least 30 genetic species delimited by a fragment of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) barcode gene. The scavenging communities sampled in the western CCZ included the most common species (Abyssorchomene gerulicorbis (Shulenberger and Barnard, 1976), A. chevreuxi (Stebbing, 1906), Paralicela caperesca Shulenberger and Barnard, 1976, and P. tenuipes Chevreux, 1908) reported for other ocean basins. Only four morphospecies, representing five genetic species, were shared between APEIs 1, 4, and 7. The two abyssal plain sites at APEIs 4 and 7 were dominated by two and three of the most common scavenging species, respectively, while the APEI 1 seamount site was dominated by two species potentially new to science that appeared to be endemic to the site. The presence of common species in all sites and high genetic diversity, yet little geographic structuring, indicate connectivity over evolutionary time scales between the areas, which span about 1500 km. Similar to recent studies, the differences in amphipod assemblages found between the seamount and abyssal sites suggest that ecological conditions on seamounts generate distinct community compositions.","[Bribiesca-Contreras, Guadalupe; Drennan, Regan; Taboada, Sergio; Wiklund, Helena; Glover, Adrian G.] Nat Hist Museum, Life Sci Dept, London, England; [Dahlgren, Thomas G.; Wiklund, Helena] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Marine Sci, Gothenburg, Sweden; [Dahlgren, Thomas G.] NORCE Norwegian Res Ctr, Bergen, Norway; [Horton, Tammy; Jones, Daniel O.

Symbiotic bacteria supply enzymes that the organisms need for nutrition and wood degradation. Some of these bacteria have been grown in pure culture and have the capacity to make many secondary metabolites. However, little is known about whether such secondary metabolite pathways are represented in the symbiont communities within their hosts. In addition, little has been reported about the patterns of host-symbiont co-occurrence. Here, we collected shipworms from the United States, the Philippines, and Brazil and cultivated symbiotic bacteria from their gills. We analyzed sequences from 22 shipworm gill metagenomes from seven shipworm species and from 23 cultivated symbiont isolates. Using (meta)genome sequencing, we demonstrate that the cultivated isolates represent all the major bacterial symbiont species and strains in shipworm gills. We show that the bacterial symbionts are distributed among shipworm hosts in consistent, predictable patterns. The symbiotic bacteria harbor many gene cluster families (GCF5) for biosynthesis of bioactive secondary metabolites, only <5% of which match previously described biosynthetic pathways. Because we were able to cultivate the symbionts and to sequence their genomes, we can definitively enumerate the biosynthetic pathways in these symbiont communities, showing that similar to 150 of similar to 200 total biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) present in the animal gill metagenomes are represented in our culture collection. Shipworm symbionts occur in suites that differ predictably across a wide taxonomic and geographic range of host species and collectively constitute an immense resource for the discovery of new biosynthetic pathways corresponding to bioactive secondary metabolites. IMPORTANCE We define a system in which the major symbionts that are important to host biology and to the production of secondary metabolites can be cultivated. We show that symbiotic bacteria that are critical to host nutrition and lifestyle also have an immense capacity to produce a multitude of diverse and likely novel bioactive secondary metabolites that could lead to the discovery of drugs and that these pathways are found within shipworm gills. We propose that, by shaping associated microbial communities within the host, the compounds support the ability of shipworms to degrade wood in marine environments. Because these symbionts can be cultivated and genetically manipulated, they provide a powerful model for understanding how secondary metabolism impacts microbial symbiosis.","[Altamia, Marvin A.; Distel, Daniel L.] Northeastern Univ, Ocean Genome Legacy Ctr, Dept Marine & Environm Sci, Nahant, MA USA; [Altamia, Marvin A.; Uy, Iris Diana; Concepcion, Gisela P.] Univ Philippines Diliman, Marine Sci Inst, Quezon City, Philippines; [Lin, Zhenjian; Schmidt, Eric W.; Haygood, Margo G.] Univ Utah, Dept Med Chem, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA; [Trindade-Silva, Amaro E.] Univ Fed Bahia, Bioinformat & Microbial Ecol Lab BIOME, Salvador, BA, Brazil; [Trindade-Silva, Amaro E.; Wilke, Diego Veras] Univ Fed Ceara, Drug Res & Dev Ctr, Dept Physiol & Pharmacol, Fortaleza, Ceara, Brazil; [Uy, Iris Diana; Concepcion, Gisela P.] Univ Philippines Diliman, Philippine Genome Ctr, Quezon City, Philippines; [Shipway, J.

The genomic basis of the unique physiological and ecological traits enabling these species to thrive in diverse marine habitats remains largely unknown. Additionally, many populations have drastically declined due to anthropogenic activities over the past two centuries, and their recovery is a high global conservation priority. We generated and analyzed high-quality reference genomes for the leatherback (Dermochelys coriacea) and green (Chelonia mydas) turtles, representing the two extant sea turtle families. These genomes are highly syntenic and homologous, but localized regions of noncollinearity were associated with higher copy numbers of immune, zinc-finger, and olfactory receptor (OR) genes in green turtles, with ORs related to waterborne odorants greatly expanded in green turtles. Our findings suggest that divergent evolution of these key gene families may underlie immunological and sensory adaptations assisting navigation, occupancy of neritic versus pelagic environments, and diet specialization. Reduced collinearity was especially prevalent in microchromosomes, with greater gene content, heterozygosity, and genetic distances between species, supporting their critical role in vertebrate evolutionary adaptation. Finally, diversity and demographic histories starkly contrasted between species, indicating that leatherback turtles have had a low yet stable effective population size, exhibit extremely low diversity compared with other reptiles, and harbor a higher genetic load compared with green turtles, reinforcing concern over their persistence under future climate scenarios. These genomes provide invaluable resources for advancing our understanding of evolution and conservation best practices in an imperiled vertebrate lineage.","[Bentley, Blair P.; Banerjee, Shreya M.; Komoroske, Lisa M.] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Environm Conservat, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Carrasco-Valenzuela, Tomas; Ramos, Elisa K.

These interactions have been studied via culturing, single-gene diversity and metagenomic read survey methods that are limited by culturing biases and fragmented genetic characterizations. Higher-resolution frameworks are needed to resolve the physiological interactions within these algal-bacterial communities. Here, we infer the encoded metabolic capabilities of four uncultured bacterial genomes (reconstructed using metagenomic assembly and binning) associated with the marine dinoflagellates Gambierdiscus carolinianus and G. caribaeus. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that two of the genomes belong to the commonly algae-associated families Rhodobacteraceae and Flavobacteriaceae. The other two genomes belong to the Phycisphaeraceae and include the first algae-associated representative within the uncultured SM1A02 group. Analyses of all four genomes suggest these bacteria are facultative aerobes, with some capable of metabolizing phytoplanktonic organosulfur compounds including dimethylsulfoniopropionate and sulfated polysaccharides. These communities may biosynthesize compounds beneficial to both the algal host and other bacteria, including iron chelators, B vitamins, methionine, lycopene, squalene and polyketides. These findings have implications for marine carbon and nutrient cycling and provide a greater depth of understanding regarding the genetic potential for complex physiological interactions between microalgae and their associated bacteria.","[Rambo, Ian M.; Dombrowski, Nina; Constant, Lauren; Erdner, Deana; Baker, Brett J.] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Marine Sci, 750 Channel View Dr, Port Aransas, TX 78373 USA; [Dombrowski, Nina] Univ Utrecht, Royal Netherlands Inst Sea Res, Dept Marine Microbiol & Biogeochem, NIOZ, Den Burg, Netherlands","University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; Utrecht University; Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea Research (NIOZ)","Baker, BJ (corresponding author), Univ Texas Austin, Dept Marine Sci, 750 Channel View Dr, Port Aransas, TX 78373 USA.","acidophile@gmail.com","Dombrowski, Nina/L-8535-2017; Baker, Brett/P-1783-2014; Erdner, Deana/C-4981-2008","Erdner, Deana/0000-0002-1736-8835","University of Texas Austin VPR grant; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ECOHAB program [NA11NOS4780061]; Sloan Foundation [FG-2016-6301]","University of Texas Austin VPR grant; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ECOHAB program(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); Sloan Foundation(Alfred P.

Very often, sequenced samples encompass organisms spanning multiple domains of life, necessitating increasingly elaborate software for accurate taxonomic classification of assembled sequences. Results While many software tools for taxonomic classification exist, SprayNPray offers a quick and user-friendly, semi-automated approach, allowing users to separate contigs by taxonomy (and other metrics) of interest. Easy installation, usage, and intuitive output, which is amenable to visual inspection and/or further computational parsing, will reduce barriers for biologists beginning to analyze genomes and metagenomes. This approach can be used for broad-level overviews, preliminary analyses, or as a supplement to other taxonomic classification or binning software. SprayNPray profiles contigs using multiple metrics, including closest homologs from a user-specified reference database, gene density, read coverage, GC content, tetranucleotide frequency, and codon-usage bias. Conclusions The output from this software is designed to allow users to spot-check metagenome-assembled genomes, identify, and remove contigs from putative contaminants in isolate assemblies, identify bacteria in eukaryotic assemblies (and vice-versa), and identify possible horizontal gene transfer events.","[Garber, Arkadiy I.] Arizona State Univ, Biodesign Ctr Mech Evolut, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Armbruster, Catherine R.; Cooper, Vaughn S.; Bomberger, Jennifer M.] Univ Pittsburgh, Sch Med, Dept Microbiol & Mol Genet, Pittsburgh, PA 15219 USA; [Lee, Stella E.] Univ Pittsburgh, Med Ctr, Dept Otolaryngol, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; [McAllister, Sean M.] NOAA, Pacific Marine Environm Lab, Seattle, WA 98115 USA; [McAllister, Sean M.] Univ Washington, Cooperat Inst Climate Ocean & Ecosyst Studies, Seattle, WA 98105 USA","Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle","Garber, AI (corresponding author), Arizona State Univ, Biodesign Ctr Mech Evolut, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.;McAllister, SM (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Cooperat Inst Climate Ocean & Ecosyst Studies, Seattle, WA 98105 USA.","agarber4@asu.edu; mcallis@uw.edu","","","Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (CFF) Carol Basbaum Memorial Research Fellowship [ARMBRU19F0]; National Institutes of Health (NIH) [T32HL129949]; University of Pittsburgh CTSI Pilot Program; NIH NCATS [UL1 TR0000005]; NIH [R33HL137077, U01AI124302, R01HL123771]; GILEAD Investigator Sponsored Research Award; CFF [BOMBER18G0]; CFF RDP [BOMBER19R0]; Joint Institute for the Study of the Atmosphere and Ocean (JISAO) under NOAA [NA15OAR4320063]; National Heart Lung and Blood Institute [R33HL137077] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (CFF) Carol Basbaum Memorial Research Fellowship; National Institutes of Health (NIH)(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); University of Pittsburgh CTSI Pilot Program; NIH NCATS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS)); NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); GILEAD Investigator Sponsored Research Award(Gilead Sciences); CFF; CFF RDP; Joint Institute for the Study of the Atmosphere and Ocean (JISAO) under NOAA; National Heart Lung and Blood Institute(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Heart Lung & Blood Institute (NHLBI))","This publication was supported in part by a Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (CFF) Carol Basbaum Memorial Research Fellowship (ARMBRU19F0) and National Institutes of Health (NIH) T32HL129949 to CRA, University of Pittsburgh CTSI Pilot Program and NIH NCATS UL1 TR0000005 to SEL and JMB, NIH R33HL137077 and GILEAD Investigator Sponsored Research Award to SEL, VSC, and JMB, NIH U01AI124302 to VSC, and NIH R01HL123771, CFF BOMBER18G0, and CFF RDP BOMBER19R0 to JMB.

Here, we present a genomic analysis of population structure that uses a landscape genetics approach to characterize patterns of variation in adult red snapper in the Gulf of Mexico (GOM) alongside a synoptic view of decades of stock-structure research. The results support Atlantic and GOM stocks and indicate weak heterogeneity within the GOM. Furthermore, redundancy analysis using Moran Eigenvector Maps based on physical distance, larval dispersal probability, and adult dispersal probability reveal heterogeneity on various spatial scales, with adult movement explaining a larger component of variation than spatial position or larval dispersal. Results of this study support the idea that red snapper in the GOM display metapopulation structure, but also suggest a potential genetic discontinuity along the West Florida Shelf not previously described. The approach of using landscape genomics and dispersal data (larval and/or adult) to better understand metapopulation dynamics is promising for not only red snapper, but also for other marine species that occupy a diversity of habitats and are seemingly distributed continuously.","[Portnoy, David S.; Fields, Andrew T.; Hollenbeck, Christopher M.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Life Sci, 6300 Ocean Dr, Corpus Christi, TX 78412 USA; [Puritz, Jonathan B.] Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Biol Sci, 120 Flagg Rd, Kingston, RI 02881 USA; [Hollenbeck, Christopher M.] Texas A&M AgriLife Res, 600 John Kimbrough Blvd, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Patterson, William F., III] Univ Florida, Inst Food & Agr Sci, Sch Forest Fisheries & Geomat Sci, Fisheries & Aquat Sci, 7922 NW 71St St, Gainesville, FL 32653 USA","Texas A&M University System; University of Rhode Island; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; Texas A&M AgriLife Research; State University System of Florida; University of Florida","Portnoy, DS (corresponding author), Texas A&M Univ, Dept Life Sci, 6300 Ocean Dr, Corpus Christi, TX 78412 USA.","david.portnoy@tamucc.edu","Puritz, Jonathan/C-9289-2011","Portnoy, David/0000-0002-8178-1018","Gulf of Mexico Research Initiative/C-IMAGE III [SA 1816]; NOAA/NMFS Marine Fisheries Initiative [NA12NMF4330093]","Gulf of Mexico Research Initiative/C-IMAGE III; NOAA/NMFS Marine Fisheries Initiative","This research was made possible by a grant from The Gulf of Mexico Research Initiative/C-IMAGE III, number SA 1816 and NOAA/NMFS Marine Fisheries Initiative Grant number NA12NMF4330093.",NA,67,9,9,1,8,"OXFORD UNIV PRESS","OXFORD","GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","1054-3139","1095-9289","","ICES J MAR SCI","ICES J.

NOV.; DIVERSITY; HEALTH; GROWTH; SILVA","Quiescence, or dormancy, is a response to stressful conditions in which an organism slows or halts physiological functioning. Although most species that undergo dormancy maintain complex microbiomes, there is little known about how dormancy influences and is influenced by the host's microbiome, including in the temperate coral Astrangia poculata. Northern populations of A. poculata undergo winter quiescence. Here, we characterized wild A. poculata microbiomes in a high-resolution sampling time series before, during, and after quiescence using 16S rRNA gene sequencing on active (RNA) and present (DNA) microbiomes. We observed a restructuring of the coral microbiome during quiescence that persisted after reemergence. Upon entering quiescence, corals shed copiotrophic microbes, including putative pathogens, suggesting a removal of these taxa as corals cease normal functioning. During and after quiescence, bacteria and archaea associated with nitrification were enriched, suggesting that the quiescent microbiome may replace essential functions through supplying nitrate to corals and/or microbes. Overall, this study demonstrates that key microbial groups related to quiescence in A. poculata may play a role in the onset or emergence from dormancy and long-term regulation of the microbiome composition. The predictability of dormancy in A. poculata provides an ideal natural manipulation system to further identify factors that regulate host-microbial associations.IMPORTANCE Using a high-resolution sampling time series, this study is the first to demonstrate a persistent microbial community shift with quiescence (dormancy) in a marine organism, the temperate coral Astrangia poculata. Furthermore, during this period of community turnover, there is a shedding of putative pathogens and copiotrophs and an enhancement of the ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (Nitrosococcales) and archaea (Candidatus Nitrosopumilus). Our results suggest that quiescence represents an important period during which the coral microbiome can reset, shedding opportunistic microbes and enriching for the reestablishment of beneficial associates, including those that may contribute nitrate while the coral animal is not actively feeding. We suggest that this work provides foundational understanding of the interplay of microbes and the host's dormancy response in marine organisms. Using a high-resolution sampling time series, this study is the first to demonstrate a persistent microbial community shift with quiescence (dormancy) in a marine organism, the temperate coral Astrangia poculata. Furthermore, during this period of community turnover, there is a shedding of putative pathogens and copiotrophs and an enhancement of the ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (Nitrosococcales) and archaea (Candidatus Nitrosopumilus).","[Brown, Anya L.; Apprill, Amy] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; [Sharp, Koty] Roger Williams Univ, Bristol, RI USA; [Brown, Anya L.] Univ Calif Davis, Bodega Marine Lab, Bodega Bay, CA USA","Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution; University of California System; University of California Davis","Brown, AL (corresponding author), Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.","anybrown@ucdavis.edu","","Sharp, Koty/0000-0001-6762-7682; Brown, Anya/0000-0002-0436-1458","WHOI Postdoctoral Scholar Award; NOAA OAR Cooperative Institutes [NA19OAR4320074]; National Science Foundation award [OCE-1938147]; Institutional Development Award (IDeA) Network for Biomedical Research Excellence from the National Institute of General Medical Sciences of the National Institutes of Health [P20GM103430]","WHOI Postdoctoral Scholar Award; NOAA OAR Cooperative Institutes(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); National Science Foundation award(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Institutional Development Award (IDeA) Network for Biomedical Research Excellence from the National Institute of General Medical Sciences of the National Institutes of Health","A.L.B. was funded by a WHOI Postdoctoral Scholar Award.

The biosynthetic pathway to isodomoic acid A was recently solved in the harmful algal bloom-forming diatom Pseudonitzschia multiseries, establishing the genetic basis for the global production of this potent neurotoxin. Herein, we sequenced the 507-Mb genome of Chondria armata, the red macroalgal seaweed from which DA was first isolated in the 1950s, identifying several copies of the red algal DA (rad) biosynthetic gene cluster. The rad genes are organized similarly to the diatom DA biosynthesis cluster in terms of gene synteny, including a cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzyme critical to DA production that is notably absent in red algae that produce the simpler kainoid neurochemical, kainic acid. The biochemical characterization of the N-prenyltransferase (RadA) and kainoid synthase (RadC) enzymes support a slightly altered DA biosynthetic model in C. armata via the congener isodomoic acid B, with RadC behaving more like the homologous diatom enzyme despite higher amino acid similarity to red algal kainic acid synthesis enzymes. A phylogenetic analysis of the rad genes suggests unique origins for the red macroalgal and diatom genes in their respective hosts, with native eukaryotic CYP450 neofunctionalization combining with the horizontal gene transfer of N-prenyltransferases and kainoid synthases to establish DA production within the algal lineages.","[Steele, Taylor S.; Brunson, John K.; Moore, Bradley S.] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, Ctr Marine Biotechnol & Biomed, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Steele, Taylor S.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Chem & Biochem, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Brunson, John K.; Allen, Andrew E.] J Craig Venter Inst, Microbial & Environm Genom Grp, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Maeno, Yukari; Yotsu-Yamashita, Mari] Tohoku Univ, Grad Sch Agr Sci, Sendai, Miyagi 9808572, Japan; [Terada, Ryuta] Kagoshima Univ, United Grad Sch Agr Sci, Kagoshima 8900065, Japan; [Allen, Andrew E.] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, Integrat Oceanog Div, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Chekan, Jonathan R.] Univ North Carolina Greensboro, Dept Chem & Biochem, Greensboro, NC 27412 USA; [Moore, Bradley S.] Univ Calif San Diego, Skaggs Sch Pharm & Pharmaceut Sci, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA","University of California System; University of California San Diego; Scripps Institution of Oceanography; University of California System; University of California San Diego; J.

Tautogs, which aggregate around structured habitats (wrecks, rocks, bridge pilings, etc.), are slow to mature and have a low reproductive rate relative to other teleosts. Slow growth and easy catchability result in Tautogs being extremely vulnerable to overexploitation, and their populations are slow to rebuild. At present, Tautogs are managed by the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission as four separate regions: Massachusetts-Rhode Island, Long Island Sound, New Jersey-New York Bight, and Delaware-Maryland-Virginia, despite a lack of genetic information to support this management scenario. The objective of the current study was to investigate the genetic connectivity of Tautogs throughout their management zone and provide stock structure information in support of fisheries management. We developed and used 18 variable microsatellite loci to evaluate the genetic structure of 789 Tautogs sampled across their effective U.S. East Coast range from Massachusetts to North Carolina. We also amplified and sequenced a 1,267 base pair portion of the mitochondrial DNA control region from Tautogs sampled from Massachusetts and Virginia. Comparison of pairwise F-ST values among samples collected from locations south of Cape Cod, Massachusetts, were low and nonsignificant, suggesting that gene flow is sufficient to prevent the accumulation of genetic differences. The collection from Cape Cod Bay, Massachusetts, was genetically distinct from all other samples (F-ST = 0.021 to 0.046), indicating that Cape Cod is a significant barrier to dispersal for Tautogs and suggesting that Tautogs north and south of Cape Cod should be managed as separate stocks.","[Small, Hamish J.; Song, Jingwei; McDowell, Jan.

IRI-160 is an algicidal bacterium that secretes an algicide, IRI-160AA. This algicide specifically targets dinoflagellates, while having no adverse effects on other algal species tested. Dinoflagellates exposed to IRI-160AA exhibited increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), DNA damage, and cell cycle arrest, implying a programmed pathway leading to cell death (PCD). Here, a metabolomic analysis was conducted on dinoflagellate Karlodinium veneficum and a control cryptophyte species Rhodomonas exposed to IRI-160AA to investigate the cellular mechanisms behind the physiological effects and the specificity of this algicide. Results of this research supported previous observations about physiological responses to the algicide. A suite of metabolites was identified that increased in the cell pellets of K. veneficum but not in Rhodomonas, including oxidative stress biomarkers, antioxidants, and compounds involved in DNA damage and PCD. Overall, the results of this study illustrated the metabolomic mechanisms underlying the algicidal effects of IRI-160AA on dinoflagellates.

How the ecosystem responds varies depending on the intensity, duration, and composition of the bloom. When the bloom has a direct or indirect negative impact on the ecosystem, it is termed a harmful algal bloom (HAB). HAB frequency is expected to increase in response to changing oceanic conditions and coastal nutrient supply. Characterizing the response of the bacterial and archaeal communities to HABs will improve our understanding of the ecological impacts of these phenomena. We utilized time series of chlorophyll a, phaeophytin, dissolved oxygen, flow cytometry cell counts, and microbial community structure (assessed via 16S rRNA gene sequences) maintained by several observing programs to investigate how the microbial community was affected by an exceptional bloom of Lingulodinium polyedra in coastal Southern California. These multi-year datasets allowed us to compare the microbial community response to past events, such as a smaller L. polyedra bloom the previous year. We demonstrated that the bacterial and archaeal response to the 2020 bloom was unique taxonomically, with many novel heterotrophs, and higher trophic state variance. The measured heterotrophic response to the bloom resulted in massive oxygen drawdown and may have impacted the length of the bloom and contributed to a secondary diatom bloom following the main HAB event. Taken together, these data illustrate how the massive 2020 L. polyedra bloom created unique ecological conditions for coastal Southern California.","[Wilson, Jesse M.; Erazo, Natalia; Connors, Elizabeth; Chamberlain, Emelia J.; Clements, Samantha M.; Carter, Melissa L.; Smith, Jennifer E.; Bowman, Jeff S.] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, San Diego, CA 92103 USA; [Bowman, Jeff S.] Univ Calif San Diego, Ctr Microbiome Innovat, San Diego, CA 92103 USA; [Bowman, Jeff S.] Univ Calif San Diego, Ctr Marine Biodivers & Conservat, San Diego, CA 92103 USA","University of California System; University of California San Diego; Scripps Institution of Oceanography; University of California System; University of California San Diego; University of California System; University of California San Diego","Wilson, JM (corresponding author), Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, San Diego, CA 92103 USA.","jmwilson@ucsd.edu","","Chamberlain, Emelia Janthina/0000-0003-2218-3488; Bowman, Jeff/0000-0002-8811-6280; Connors, Elizabeth/0000-0002-4992-4218; Erazo, Natalia G./0000-0002-7498-0860","National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration [NOAA NA16NOS0120022, NA11NOS120029, NA17RJ1231]; MacArthur Foundation; Simons Foundation Early Career Marine Microbial Ecology and Evolution award","National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); MacArthur Foundation; Simons Foundation Early Career Marine Microbial Ecology and Evolution award","The Southern California Coastal Ocean Observing Harmful Algal Bloom Monitoring Program was supported by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA NA16NOS0120022, NA11NOS120029, and NA17RJ1231).

Several studies have described the dysregulation of miRNAs in temperature and hypoxic stress responses of marine organisms, but their role in the response to acidification conditions has remained relatively underexplored. We investigated the differential expression of miRNAs in whole brain tissue of Arctic cod (Boregogadus saida) exposed to elevated aqueous CO2 levels representative of future climate change predictions. We detected the expression of 17 miRNAs of interest that are either directly or indirectly associated with reduced auditory performance; 12 of the 17 miRNAs showed significant differential expression in high treatment vs. low (control) aqueous CO2 conditions. Target gene predictions indicated that these miRNAs are likely involved with inner ear maintenance, hair cell degradation, age-related hearing loss, neural inflammation, and injury. The highest differential expression was observed in mir-135b, which is linked with increased neural inflammation and injury that may be associated with neurosensory dysfunction. Collectively, these results elucidate the contributions of miRNA mechanisms underlying CO2-induced sensory deficits in fishes facing abiotic environmental change and suggest strong potential for this approach to yield novel insights into the mechanistic effects of climate change on marine organisms.","[Schweitzer, Cara C.; Bonin, Carolina A.; Horodysky, Andrij Z.] Hampton Univ, Dept Marine & Environm Sci, Hampton, VA 23669 USA; [Schweitzer, Cara C.] NOAA, Habitat Conservat, Habitat Protect, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv NMFS, Silver Spring, MD USA; [Magel, Christopher; Hurst, Thomas P.] NOAA, Fisheries Behav Ecol Program, Resource Assessment & Conservat Engn Div, Alaska Fisheries Sci Ctr,Natl Marine Fisheries Ser, Newport, OR USA; [Horodysky, Andrij Z.] NOAA, James J Howard Lab, Northeast Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv NMFS, Highlands, NJ 07732 USA","Hampton University; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA","Horodysky, AZ (corresponding author), Hampton Univ, Dept Marine & Environm Sci, Hampton, VA 23669 USA.;Horodysky, AZ (corresponding author), NOAA, James J Howard Lab, Northeast Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv NMFS, Highlands, NJ 07732 USA.","andrij.horodysky@noaa.gov","","Bonin Lewallen, Carolina/0000-0003-1162-7290","AH and CS were supported by NSF-CAREER #1846004 while at Hampton University.

Currently, heterotrophic cultivation of H. pluvialis is limited by slow growth rates. This work aimed to address this challenge by exploring the mechanisms of acetate metabolism in Haematococcus. Chemical mutagenesis and screening identified H. pluvialis strain KREMS 23D-3 that achieved up to a 34.9% higher cell density than the wild type when grown heterotrophically on acetate. An integrative proteomics and phosphoproteomics approach was employed to quantify 4955 proteins and 5099 phosphorylation sites from 2505 phosphoproteins in the wild-type and mutant strains of H. pluvialis. Among them, 12 proteins were significantly upregulated and 22 significantly downregulated in the mutant while phosphoproteomic analysis identified 143 significantly upregulated phosphorylation sites on 106 proteins and 130 downregulated phosphorylation sites on 114 proteins. Upregulation of anaphase-promoting complex phosphoproteins and downregulation of a putative cell cycle division 20 phosphoprotein in the mutant suggests rapid mitotic progression, coinciding with higher cell division rates. Upregulated coproporphyrinogen oxidase and phosphorylated magnesium chelatase in the mutant demonstrated altered nitrogen partitioning toward chlorophyll biosynthesis. The large proportion of differentially expressed phosphoproteins suggests phosphorylation is a key regulator for protein expression and activity in Haematococcus. Taken together, this study reveals the regulation of interrelated acetate metabolic pathways in H. pluvialis and provides protein targets that may guide future strain engineering work.","[Ramarui, Kyarii; Li, Yantao] Univ Maryland, Ctr Environm Sci, Inst Marine & Environm Technol, 701 Pratt St, Baltimore, MD 21202 USA; [Ramarui, Kyarii; Li, Yantao] Univ Maryland Baltimore Cty, 701 Pratt St, Baltimore, MD 21202 USA; [Zhong, Jun] Delta Om Inc, Rockville, MD USA","University System of Maryland; University of Maryland Baltimore; University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science; Institute of Marine & Environmental Technology; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland Baltimore County","Li, YT (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Ctr Environm Sci, Inst Marine & Environm Technol, 701 Pratt St, Baltimore, MD 21202 USA.;Li, YT (corresponding author), Univ Maryland Baltimore Cty, 701 Pratt St, Baltimore, MD 21202 USA.","yantao@umces.edu","Zhong, Jun/D-1662-2010; Li, Yantao/AAT-1656-2020","Zhong, Jun/0000-0003-3148-4143; Li, Yantao/0000-0001-7545-1883; Ramarui, Kyarii/0000-0002-2823-6803","Maryland Industrial Partnerships [6510]; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration [NA16SEC4810007]","Maryland Industrial Partnerships; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA)","Maryland Industrial Partnerships, Grant/Award Number: 6510; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Grant/Award Number: NA16SEC4810007",NA,58,1,1,7,7,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","0022-3646","1529-8817","","J PHYCOL","J.

Population genomics metrics, such as genetic diversity and population connectivity, serve as useful proxies for species health and stability. Sleeper sharks (genus Somniosus) are ecologically important deep-sea predators, estimated to reach ages of 250 to 300 yr and taking decades to reach sexual maturity. The subgenus Somniosus (Somniosus) is comprised of 3 species: S. pacificus, S. microcephalus, and S. antarcticus. Given the life history strategy of somniosids, they are vulnerable to overfishing and population declines. Further, data to assess the stocks of these species are limited. To address this deficiency, we used the reduced representation library method Restriction-site Associated DNA sequencing (RADseq) to conduct phylogenomic and population genomics analyses, providing novel information for use in stock assessments. Our results strongly support the species status of S. microcephalus (N = 79), but recover S. antarcticus (N = 2) intermixed within the S. pacificus (N = 170) clade. Population genomics analyses reveal genetic homogeneity within S. pacificus and S. microcephalus, and estimates of effective population size were in the hundreds for both species. Kinship analysis identified 2 first-degree relative pairs within our dataset (1 within each species). Our results contribute new information for stock assessments of these uniquely long-lived species by providing the strongest molecular evidence to date for the synonymization of S. antarcticus and S. pacificus, as well as estimating population genomic metrics for each supported species within the Somniosus (Somniosus) subgenus.","[Timm, Laura E.; Tribuzio, Cindy; Larson, Wesley A.; Wildes, Sharon] Alaska Fisheries Sci Ctr, Genet Program, Auke Bay Labs, Juneau, AK 99801 USA; [Timm, Laura E.] Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Coll Fisheries & Ocean Sci, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA; [Walter, Ryan P.] Calif State Univ Fullerton, Coll Nat Sci & Math, Dept Biol Sci, Fullerton, CA USA; [Murray, Brent W.] Univ Northern British Columbia, Dept Ecosyst Sci & Management, Prince George, BC, Canada; [Hussey, Nigel E.] Univ Windsor, Dept Integrat Biol, Windsor, ON, Canada","National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of Alaska System; University of Alaska Fairbanks; California State University System; California State University Fullerton; University of Northern British Columbia; University of Windsor","Timm, LE (corresponding author), Alaska Fisheries Sci Ctr, Genet Program, Auke Bay Labs, Juneau, AK 99801 USA.;Timm, LE (corresponding author), Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Coll Fisheries & Ocean Sci, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA.","laura.timm@noaa.gov","Murray, Brent/F-5031-2012","Wildes, Sharon/0000-0002-4302-3195; Larson, Wesley/0000-0003-4473-3401; Timm, Laura E/0000-0002-7285-0261","Cooperative Institute for Climate, Ocean, and Ecosystem Studies (CICOES) under National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA); Alaska Fisheries Science Center; Government of Nunavut, Nunavut Fisheries, World Wildlife-Canada, Arctic Net; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC); [NA20OAR4320271]","Cooperative Institute for Climate, Ocean, and Ecosystem Studies (CICOES) under National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); Alaska Fisheries Science Center; Government of Nunavut, Nunavut Fisheries, World Wildlife-Canada, Arctic Net; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC)(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC));","This work was supported by the Cooperative Institute for Climate, Ocean, and Ecosystem Studies (CICOES) under National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Cooperative Agreement NA20OAR4320271 to LET, contribution number 2022-1247.

Most species within the family possess autogenic bioluminescent photophores in one of three distinct forms: lensed photophores; non-lensed photophores; or internal organs of Pesta. This morphological diversity across the Sergestidae has resulted in recent major taxonomic revisions, dividing the two major genera (Sergio Stimpson, 1860 and Sergestes Milne Edwards, 1830) into 15. The present study capitalises on molecular data to construct an updated genus-level phylogeny of sergestid shrimp. DNA was successfully extracted from 87 individuals belonging to 13 of the 15 newly proposed genera. A 'genome skimming' approach was implemented, allowing the capture of mitochondria] genomic data across 19 sergestid species. Additional individuals have been incorporated into the phylogeny through Sanger sequencing of both nuclear (H3 and NAK) and mitochondria] (165 and COI) genes. The resulting molecular phylogeny is compared with previous morphological trees with specific attention to genus-level relationships. The-sergestes group was rendered non-monophyletic and the -sergia group was recovered as monophyletic. Ancestral state reconstructions of light organ type indicate that organs of Pesta is the ancestral state for the family.

Yet, the mechanistic underpinnings and long-term implications of these changes are poorly understood. This work studied the modifications in coral DNA methylation, an epigenetic mechanism involved in coral acclimatization, in response to symbiont manipulation and subsequent heat stress exposure. Symbiont composition was manipulated in the great star coral Montastraea cavernosa through controlled thermal bleaching and recovery, producing paired ramets of three genets dominated by either their native symbionts (genus Cladocopium) or the thermotolerant species (Durusdinium trenchi). Single-base genome-wide analyses showed significant modifications in DNA methylation concentrated in intergenic regions, introns and transposable elements. Remarkably, DNA methylation changes in response to heat stress were dependent on the dominant symbiont, with twice as many differentially methylated regions found in heat-stressed corals hosting different symbionts (Cladocopium vs. D. trenchii) compared to all other comparisons. Interestingly, while differential gene body methylation was not correlated with gene expression, an enrichment in differentially methylated regions was evident in repetitive genome regions. Overall, these results suggest that changes in algal symbionts favouring heat tolerant associations are accompanied by changes in DNA methylation in the coral host. The implications of these results for coral adaptation, along with future avenues of research based on current knowledge gaps, are discussed in the present work.","[Rodriguez-Casariego, Javier A.; Eirin-Lopez, Jose M.] Florida Int Univ, Environm Epigenet Lab, Inst Environm, Miami, FL 33199 USA; [Cunning, Ross] John G Shedd Aquarium, Daniel P Haerther Ctr Conservat & Res, Chicago, IL USA; [Cunning, Ross; Baker, Andrew C.] Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Dept Marine Biol & Ecol, 4600 Rickenbacker Causeway, Miami, FL 33149 USA","State University System of Florida; Florida International University; University of Miami","Eirin-Lopez, JM (corresponding author), Florida Int Univ, Environm Epigenet Lab, North Miami, FL 33181 USA.","jeirinlo@fiu.edu","","Rodriguez Casariego, Javier A./0000-0001-9955-4721; Cunning, Ross/0000-0001-7241-1181; Baker, Andrew/0000-0002-7866-2587","National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration [NA21NMF4820301]; Mote Marine Laboratory and Aquarium [POR2016--15]; National Science Foundation [1547798, 1921402]; Direct For Biological Sciences; Emerging Frontiers [1921402] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Direct For Education and Human Resources; Division Of Human Resource Development [1547798] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); Mote Marine Laboratory and Aquarium; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Direct For Biological Sciences; Emerging Frontiers(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)); Direct For Education and Human Resources; Division Of Human Resource Development(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for STEM Education (EDU))","National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Grant/Award Number: NA21NMF4820301; Mote Marine Laboratory and Aquarium, Grant/Award Number: POR2016--15; National Science Foundation, Grant/Award Number: 1547798 and 1921402",NA,68,17,19,2,28,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","0962-1083","1365-294X","","MOL ECOL","Mol.

While RNA-Seq can detect gene expression variation among wild-caught individuals and yield important insights into biological function, sampling methods can also affect gene expression estimates. We examined the influence of multiple technical variables on estimated gene expression in a non-model fish, the westslope cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii lewisi), using two RNA-Seq library types: 3 & PRIME; RNA-Seq (QuantSeq) and whole mRNA-Seq (NEB). We evaluated effects of dip netting versus electrofishing, and of harvesting tissue immediately versus 5 min after euthanasia on estimated gene expression in blood, gill, and muscle. We found no significant differences in gene expression between sampling methods or tissue collection times with either library type. When library types were compared using the same blood samples, 58% of genes detected by both NEB and QuantSeq showed significantly different expression between library types, and NEB detected 31% more genes than QuantSeq. Although the two library types recovered different numbers of genes and expression levels, results with NEB and QuantSeq were consistent in that neither library type showed differences in gene expression between sampling methods and tissue harvesting times. Our study suggests that researchers can safely rely on different fish sampling strategies in the field. In addition, while QuantSeq is more cost effective, NEB detects more expressed genes. Therefore, when it is crucial to detect as many genes as possible (especially low expressed genes), when alternative splicing is of interest, or when working with an organism lacking good genomic resources, whole mRNA-Seq is more powerful.","[Chiari, Ylenia; Moreno, Nickolas] George Mason Univ, Dept Biol, Fairfax, VA USA; [Howard, Leif; Luikart, Gordon] Univ Montana, Div Biol Sci, Montana Conservat Genom Lab, Flathead Lake Biol Stn, Missoula, MT USA; [Howard, Leif; Luikart, Gordon] Univ Montana, Coll Forestry & Conservat, Wildlife Biol Program, Missoula, MT USA; [Relyea, Scott; Dunnigan, James] Montana Fish Wildlife & Pk, Sekokini Springs Hatchery, Bozeman, MT USA; [Boyer, Matthew C.

Overprinted on this geologic history, recent global and local stressors have led to degraded reefs dominated by fleshy algae, soft corals, and sponges. Here, we assessed how coral physiology (calcification rate, tissue thickness, reproduction, symbiosis, and bleaching) varies seasonally (winter vs. summer) and geographically using 40 colonies of the mustard hill coral Porites astreoides from four sites across 350 km along the FKRT from 2015 to 2017. The study coincided with a high-temperature event in late summer 2015 that caused heterogeneous levels of coral bleaching across sites. Bleaching severity differed by site, with bleaching response more aligned with heat stress retroactively calculated from local degree heating weeks than those predicted by satellites. Despite differences in temperature profiles and bleaching severity, all colonies hosted Symbiodiniaceae of the same genus (formerly Clade A and subtypes). Overall, P. astreoides at Dry Tortugas National Park, the consistently coolest site, had the highest calcification rates, symbiont cell densities, and reproductive potential (all colonies were reproductive, with most planula larvae per polyp). Corals at Dry Tortugas and Fowey Rocks Light demonstrated strong seasonality in net calcification (higher in summer) and did not express visual or partial-mortality responses from the bleaching event; in contrast, colonies in the middle and southern part of the upper keys, Sombrero Key and Crocker Reef, demonstrated similar reduced fitness from bleaching, but differential recovery trajectories following the heat stress. Identifying reefs, such as Dry Tortugas and possibly Fowey Rocks Light that may serve as heat-stress refugia, is important in selecting candidate sites for adaptive reef-management strategies, such as selective propagation and assisted gene flow, to increase coral-species adaptation to ocean warming.","[Lenz, Elizabeth Ann] Hawaii Inst Marine Biol, Kaneohe, HI 96744 USA; [Lenz, Elizabeth Ann] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Univ Hawaii Sea Grant Coll Program, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Bartlett, Lucy A.; Stathakopoulos, Anastasios; Kuffner, Ilsa B.] US Geol Survey, St Petersburg Coastal & Marine Sci Ctr, St Petersburg, FL USA","University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey","Lenz, EA (corresponding author), Hawaii Inst Marine Biol, Kaneohe, HI 96744 USA.;Lenz, EA (corresponding author), Univ Hawaii Manoa, Univ Hawaii Sea Grant Coll Program, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.","ealenz@hawaii.edu","Kuffner, Ilsa/A-6416-2008; Lenz, Elizabeth/KMA-6219-2024","","National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration - University of Hawaii Sea Grant College Program, SOEST under NOAA Office of Sea Grant, Department of Commerce [A/AS-1, NA18OAR4170076]","National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration - University of Hawaii Sea Grant College Program, SOEST under NOAA Office of Sea Grant, Department of Commerce","This paper was also funded in part by a grant/cooperative agreement from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Project A/AS-1, which is sponsored by the University of Hawaii Sea Grant College Program, SOEST, under Institutional Grant No. NA18OAR4170076 from NOAA Office of Sea Grant, Department of Commerce.

The greatest abundance of Abralia spp. was recorded in subsurface tows, distributed mainly off Chinchorro Bank, Cozumel, and Honduras, and in a stratum of 38-48 m depth in MOCNESS tows. Paralarvae showed evidence of ontogenetic migration with larger sizes distributed at greater depths. Sixty-eight percent of Abralia spp. had sizes of 1.1-2.0 mm mantle length (ML), indicating that the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System is an important area in the spawning and development of the genus. Twelve paralarvae were sequenced using the Cytochrome Oxidase I gene (COI) resulting in the presence of two species: Abralia redfieldi and Abralia veranyi (99.01%-100% similarity), which could not be individually identified using the morphological analysis.

These worms burrow into bivalve shells, creating unsightly mud blisters that are unappealing to consumers and, when nicked during shucking, release mud and detritus that can foul oyster meats. Recent findings of mud blisters on the shells of Pacific oysters (Crassostrea gigas Thunberg) in Washington State suggest a new spionid polychaete outbreak. To determine the identity of the polychaete causing these blisters, we obtained Pacific oysters from two locations in Puget Sound and examined them for blisters and burrows caused by polychaete worms. Specimens were also obtained from eastern oysters (Crassostrea virginica Gmelin) collected in New York for morphological and molecular comparison. We compared polychaete morphology to original descriptions, extracted DNA and sequenced mitochondrial (cytochrome c oxidase I [mtCOI]) and nuclear (small subunit 18S rRNA [18S rRNA]) genes to determine a species-level molecular identification for these worms. Our data show that Polydora websteri are present in the mud blisters from oysters grown in Puget Sound, constituting the first confirmed record of this species in Washington State. The presence of this notorious invader could threaten the sustainability of oyster aquaculture in Washington, which currently produces more farmed bivalves than any other US state.","[Martinelli, Julieta C.; Lopes, Heather M.; Hauser, Lorenz; Jimenez-Hidalgo, Isadora; Padilla-Gamino, Jacqueline L.; Spencer, Laura H.; Wood, Chelsea L.] Univ Washington, Sch Aquat & Fishery Sci, Seattle, WA 98105 USA; [King, Teri L.] Univ Washington, Washington Sea Grant, Shelton, WA 98584 USA; [Rawson, Paul] Univ Maine, Sch Marine Sci, Orono, ME 04469 USA; [Williams, Jason D.] Hofstra Univ, Dept Biol, Hempstead, NY 11549 USA","University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; University of Washington; University of Maine System; University of Maine Orono; Hofstra University","Martinelli, JC (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Sch Aquat & Fishery Sci, Seattle, WA 98105 USA.","julimar@uw.edu","Hauser, Lorenz/E-4365-2010; Padilla-Gamino, Jacqueline/AGL-6020-2022; Martinelli, Julieta/AAU-1199-2021","Wood, Chelsea/0000-0003-2738-3139; King, Teri/0000-0002-9620-3501; Martinelli, Julieta/0000-0003-4210-7642; Spencer, Laura/0000-0002-3478-8954","Sloan Research Fellowship from the Alfred P.

To assess nitrogen removal mechanisms and the efficacy of a horizontal levee, we monitored an experimental system receiving nitrified municipal wastewater effluent for 2 years. Based on mass balances and microbial gene abundance data, we determined that much of the applied nitrogen was most likely removed by heterotrophic denitrifiers that consumed labile organic carbon from decaying plants and added wood chips. Fe(III) and sulfate reduction driven by decay of labile organic carbon also produced Fe(II) sulfide minerals. During winter months, when heterotrophic activity was lower, strong correlations between sulfate release and nitrogen removal suggested that autotrophic denitrifiers oxidized Fe(II) sulfides using nitrate as an electron acceptor. These trends were seasonal, with Fe(II) sulfide minerals formed during summer fueling denitrification during the subsequent winter. Overall, around 30% of gaseous nitrogen losses in the winter were attributable to autotrophic denitrifiers. To predict long-term nitrogen removal, we developed an electron-transfer model that accounted for the production and consumption of electron donors. The model indicated that the labile organic carbon released from wood chips may be capable of supporting nitrogen removal from wastewater effluent for several decades with sulfide minerals, decaying vegetation, and root exudates likely sustaining nitrogen removal over a longer timescale.","[Cecchetti, Aidan R.; Stiegler, Angela N.; Gonthier, Emily A.; Bandaru, Siva R.

Although patterns are emerging, the environmental cues that stimulate production of microcystin remain confusing, hindering our ability to predict fluctuations in bloom toxicity. In earlier work, growth at cool temperatures relative to optimum (18 degrees C vs. 26 degrees C) was confirmed to increase microcystin quota in batch cultures of Microcystis aeruginosa NIES-843. Here, we tested this response in M. aeruginosa PCC 7806 using continuous cultures to examine temporal dynamics and using RNA-sequencing to investigate the physiological nature of the response. A temperature reduction from 26 to 19 degrees C increased microcystin quota similar to 2-fold, from an average of similar to 464 ag mu m(-3) cell volume to similar to 891 ag mu m(-3) over a 7-9 d period. Reverting the temperature to 26 degrees C returned the cellular microcystin quota to similar to 489 ag mu m(-3). Long periods (31-42 d) at 19 degrees C did not increase or decrease microcystin quota beyond that observed at 7-9 d. Nitrogen concentration had little effect on the overall response. RNA sequencing indicated that the decrease in temperature to 19 degrees C induced a classic cold-stress response in M. aeruginosa PCC 7806, but this operated on a different timescale than the increased microcystin production. Microcystin quota showed a strong 48- to 72-h time-lag correlation to mcy gene expression, but no correlation to concurrent mcy expression. This work confirms an effect of temperature on microcystin quota and extends our understanding of the physiological nature of the response.","[Martin, Robbie M.; Stark, Gwendolyn F.; Gann, Eric R.; Wilhelm, Steven W.] Univ Tennessee, Dept Microbiol, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA; [Moniruzzaman, Mohammad] Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA; [Derminio, Dominique S.; Wei, Bofan; Boyer, Gregory L.] SUNY Coll Environm Sci & Forestry, Dept Chem, Syracuse, NY 13210 USA; [Hellweger, Ferdi L.] Tech Univ Berlin, Water Qual Engn, Berlin, Germany; [Pinto, Ameet] Northeastern Univ, Civil & Environm Engn, Boston, MA 02115 USA","University of Tennessee System; University of Tennessee Knoxville; Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) College of Environmental Science & Forestry; Technical University of Berlin; Northeastern University","Wilhelm, SW (corresponding author), Univ Tennessee, Dept Microbiol, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA.","wilhelm@utk.edu","Moniruzzaman, Mohammad/H-8914-2019; Hellweger, Ferdinand/C-6838-2009; Wilhelm, Steven/B-8963-2008","Wilhelm, Steven/0000-0001-6283-8077; Pinto, Ameet/0000-0003-1089-5664; Martin, Robbie/0000-0001-5284-7156; Wei, Bofan/0009-0002-8746-1266; Boyer, Gregory/0000-0003-4490-5461","National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration [NA18NOS4780175]; National Science Foundation [IOS-1451528]; NIEHS [1P01ES028939-01]; NSF [OCE-1840715]","National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NIEHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS)); NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF))","This work was supported by grants from the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NA18NOS4780175) to SW, FH, and AP.

However, early juvenile dispersal represents a key opportunity for gene flow and colonization of new regions through founder events, making it an important yet under-studied life stage. To assess connectivity among sea turtle life stages and ocean basins, we sequenced mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) fragments from 35 juveniles sampled in the Gulf of Mexico from the rarely observed dispersal stage across three species: green turtles (Chelonia mydas; n = 30), hawksbills (Eretmochelys imbricata; n = 3), and loggerheads (Caretta caretta; n = 2). We estimated green turtle rookery contributions using a many-to-many Bayesian mixed stock analysis that incorporated dispersal probabilities based on rookery size and transport via ocean currents. We assembled a gene tree including 709 distinct mtDNA control region haplotypes from the literature for all seven extant sea turtle species to assess gaps in life-stage data across ocean basins, as well as contextualize the lineages we sampled from dispersing juveniles. Our results indicate a high likelihood that green turtles sampled in the Gulf of Mexico originated from rookeries along the coast of Mexico, with smaller contributions from Costa Rica and Suriname. The gene tree analysis yielded species-level relationships consistent with those presented previously, while intra-species relationships between lineages and ocean basins differed, particularly within loggerhead and green turtle clades. Our results highlight the lack of genetic data from juvenile sea turtles, especially the early dispersal stage, and the potential for these data to answer broader questions of connectivity and diversification across species and lineages.","[Phillips, Katrina F.; Martin, Katherine R.; Stahelin, Gustavo D.; Savage, Anna E.; Mansfield, Katherine L.] Univ Cent Florida, Dept Biol, 4000 Cent Florida Blvd,Bldg 20,BIO301, Orlando, FL 32816 USA","State University System of Florida; University of Central Florida","Phillips, KF (corresponding author), Univ Cent Florida, Dept Biol, 4000 Cent Florida Blvd,Bldg 20,BIO301, Orlando, FL 32816 USA.","katrinafphillips@gmail.com","Martin, Katherine/HJY-7977-2023; Savage, Anna/D-8296-2015; D.

Bacteria represent most of the biodiversity and play key roles in virtually every ecosystem. In doing so, bacteria act as part of complex communities shaped by interactions across all domains of life. Here, we report on direct interactions between bacteria and dreissenid mussels, a group of invasive filter-feeders threatening global aquatic systems due to high filtration rates. Previous studies showed that dreissenids can impact bacterial community structure by changing trait distributions and abundances of specific taxa. However, studies on bacterial community effects were conducted using water from Lake Michigan (an oligotrophic lake) only, and it is unknown whether similar patterns are observed in systems with differing nutrient regimes. We conducted ten short-term dreissenid grazing experiments in 2019 using water from two eutrophic lake regions-the western basin of Lake Erie and Saginaw Bay in Lake Huron. Predation by dreissenids led to decline in overall bacterial abundance and diversity in both lakes. However, feeding on bacteria was not observed during every experiment. We also found that traits related to feeding resistance are less phylogenetically conserved than previously thought. Our results highlight the role of temporal, spatial, and genomic heterogeneity in bacterial response dynamics to a globally important invasive filter feeder.","[Dahal, Nikesh; Denef, Vincent J.] Univ Michigan, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Glyshaw, Paul; Vanderploeg, Henry A.] NOAA Great Lakes Environm Res Lab, Ann Arbor, MI 48108 USA; [Carter, Glenn] Cooperat Inst Great Lakes Res, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Denef, Vincent J.] Univ Michigan, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 4060 Biol Sci Bldg, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan","Denef, VJ (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 4060 Biol Sci Bldg, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.","vdenef@umich.edu","","Glyshaw, Paul/0000-0003-1962-2021; Dahal, Nikesh/0000-0002-8673-8043","NOAA Great Lakes Omics program distributed through the UM Cooperative Institute for Great Lakes Research [NA17OAR4320152]; National Science Foundation (Division of Environmental Biology) [1737680]; Cooperative Institute for Great Lakes Research (CIGLR) at the University of Michigan; Direct For Biological Sciences [1737680] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Division Of Environmental Biology [1737680] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","NOAA Great Lakes Omics program distributed through the UM Cooperative Institute for Great Lakes Research(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); National Science Foundation (Division of Environmental Biology)(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)); Cooperative Institute for Great Lakes Research (CIGLR) at the University of Michigan; Direct For Biological Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)); Division Of Environmental Biology(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO))","This work was supported by funding from the NOAA Great Lakes Omics program distributed through the UM Cooperative Institute for Great Lakes Research (NA17OAR4320152 to V.J.D.), through the NOAA Cooperative Agreement with the Cooperative Institute for Great Lakes Research (CIGLR) at the University of Michigan (NA17OAR4320152), and the National Science Foundation (Division of Environmental Biology-1737680) to VJD.

These mats can develop into massive nuisances at risk of expansion due to climate change. The extent of diversity occurring within these mats, still remains largely unexplored, especially in Florida. To reveal this diversity, coastal environments of South Florida were sampled and subsequently processed for isolation and systematic identification. Three new genera are proposed based on the molecular phylogeny, morphology, and ecology. These new genera are characterized by discoid cells and homocytous, unbranched filaments without sheaths. Individual genus morphological differences include either rounded bent, rounded, or conical rounded apical cells. A unique molecular fingerprint including a base pair insert within the 16S rRNA gene sequence and genetic similarities facilitates the delimitation of a novel family Vermifilaceae. Using the polyphasic approach, our research presents three new genera and four new species of marine cyanobacteria inhabiting coastal ecosystems of South Florida.","[Berthold, David E.; Lefler, Forrest W.; Laughinghouse, H.

Many coastal Vibrio spp. can infect humans, representing a growing threat linked to increasing seawater temperatures. Interactions with eukaryotic organisms may provide attachment substrate and critical nutrients that facilitate the persistence, diversification, and spread of pathogenic Vibrio spp. However, vibrio interactions with planktonic organisms in an environmental context are poorly understood. We quantified the pathogenic Vibrio species V. cholerae, V. parahaemolyticus, and V. vulnificus monthly for 1 year at five sites and observed high abundances, particularly during summer months, with species-specific temperature and salinity distributions. Using metabarcoding, we established a detailed profile of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic coastal microbial communities. We found that pathogenic Vibrio species were frequently associated with distinct eukaryotic amplicon sequence variants (ASVs), including diatoms and copepods. Shared environmental conditions, such as high temperatures and low salinities, were associated with both high concentrations of pathogenic vibrios and potential environmental reservoirs, which may influence vibrio infection risks linked to climate change and should be incorporated into predictive ecological models and experimental laboratory systems. IMPORTANCE Many species of coastal vibrio bacteria can infect humans, representing a growing health threat linked to increasing seawater temperatures. However, their interactions with surrounding microbes in the environment, especially eukaryotic organisms that may provide nutrients and attachment substrate, are poorly understood. We quantified three pathogenic Vibrio species monthly for a duration of 1 year, finding that all three species were abundant and exhibited species-specific temperature and salinity distributions. Using metabarcoding, we investigated associations between these pathogenic species and prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbes, revealing genus and amplicon sequence variant (ASV)-specific relationships with potential functional implications. For example, pathogenic species were frequently associated with chitin-producing eukaryotes, such as diatoms in the genus Thalassiosira and copepods. These associations between high concentrations of pathogenic vibrios and potential environmental reservoirs should be considered when predicting infection risk and developing ecologically relevant model systems.","[Diner, Rachel E.; Rabines, Ariel; Allen, Andrew E.] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Diner, Rachel E.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Pediat, La Jolla, CA USA; [Diner, Rachel E.; Kaul, Drishti; Rabines, Ariel; Zheng, Hong; Allen, Andrew E.] J Craig Venter Inst, Microbial & Environm Genom Grp, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Steele, Joshua A.; Griffith, John F.] Southern Calif Coastal Water Res Project, Costa Mesa, CA USA","University of California System; University of California San Diego; Scripps Institution of Oceanography; University of California System; University of California San Diego; J.

Specifically, common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) populations in the southeastern United States display varying degrees of spatial overlap and residency, including some that have year-round site fidelity to localized bays, sounds, and estuaries. Evidence of resident estuarine animals along the U.S. Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico coastlines is supported through photo-identification and genetic studies, although, currently, few studies have integrated both methods. The purpose of this project was to couple long-term photo-identification data with spatial and genetic analyses to examine population structure of common bottlenose dolphins in northern Georgia. Genomic DNA was extracted from skin samples (n = 69) collected in the Northern Georgia/Southern South Carolina Estuarine System Stock, and a portion of the mitochondrial DNA control region was sequenced. To determine potential fine-scale geographic delineations within this stock, the study area was split into three regions: (1) north, (2) buffer, and (3) south. No significant genetic differentiation was found when regions were compared by only sample collection location. The sighting locations of sampled dolphins that had been seen >= 10 times between 2009 and 2017 (n = 45) were mapped in ArcMap, Version 10.2. In an analysis of dolphins with >= 10 sightings only, a significant difference in F-ST was found between the north vs buffer area (p = 0.0147). When dolphins with 10 sightings (n = 45) were assigned to the region where >= 50% of their sightings were located, a significant difference in F-ST was found between the north vs butter and north vs south regions (p = 0.0018 and p = 0.0164, respectively). The addition of spatial data revealed genetic division among, the three regions. Thus, the combination of photo-identification and genetic analyses used in this study may be useful in determining population structure in the future.","[Griffin, Emily K.; Perrtree, Robin M.; Cox, Tara M.] Savannah State Univ, Dept Marine & Environm Sci, 3219 Coll St, Savannah, GA 31404 USA; [Rosel, Patricia E.] NOAA, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, 646 Cajundome Blvd, Lafayette, LA 70506 USA; [Balmer, Brian C.] Natl Marine Mammal Fdn, 3419 Maybank Highway,Suite B, Johns Isl, SC 29455 USA; [Griffin, Emily K.] Univ Florida, Ctr Environm & Human Toxicol, Dept Physiol Sci, Coll Vet Med, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA","University System of Georgia; Savannah State University; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; State University System of Florida; University of Florida","Griffin, EK (corresponding author), Savannah State Univ, Dept Marine & Environm Sci, 3219 Coll St, Savannah, GA 31404 USA.;Griffin, EK (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Ctr Environm & Human Toxicol, Dept Physiol Sci, Coll Vet Med, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.","emilygriffin@ujl.edu","Griffin, Emily/GZN-2270-2022; Balmer, Brian/JEO-9639-2023","Perrtree, Robin/0000-0002-4787-2813; Cox, Tara/0009-0007-7802-7990; Balmer, Brian/0000-0001-9734-4042; Griffin, Emily/0000-0003-0336-7222","National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Office of Education Educational Partnership Program [NA16SEC4810007]; U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration; NOAA Living Marine Resources Cooperative Science Center (LMRCSC); NSF REU [OCE-9402526]; NOAA LMRCSC [NA16SEC4810007, NA05OAR4811017]; EDGE (NSF) [0914680]; Title VII (Department of Education) [P382G090003]; NSF GK12 [0841372]; REU (NSF OCE-REU) [1156525, 1460457]; Oak Foundation; Directorate For Geosciences [0914680] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Division Of Graduate Education; Direct For Education and Human Resources [0841372] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Office of Education Educational Partnership Program; U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); NOAA Living Marine Resources Cooperative Science Center (LMRCSC); NSF REU(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Office of the Director (OD)); NOAA LMRCSC(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); EDGE (NSF); Title VII (Department of Education); NSF GK12(National Science Foundation (NSF)); REU (NSF OCE-REU); Oak Foundation; Directorate For Geosciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO)); Division Of Graduate Education; Direct For Education and Human Resources(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for STEM Education (EDU))","This publication was made possible by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Office of Education Educational Partnership Program (Award #NA16SEC4810007).

Here we tested whether this increase in microcystin provided M. aeruginosa PCC 7806 with a fitness advantage during colder-temperature growth by comparing cell concentration, cellular physiology, reactive oxygen species damage, and the transcriptomics-inferred metabolism to a non-toxigenic mutant strain M. aeruginosa PCC 7806 Delta mcyB. Photo-physiological data combined with transcriptomic data revealed metabolic changes in the mutant strain during growth at 19 degrees C, which included increased electron sinks and non-photochemical quenching. Increased gene expression was observed for a glutathione-dependent peroxiredoxin during cold treatment, suggesting compensatory mechanisms to defend against reactive oxygen species are employed in the absence of microcystin in the mutant. Our observations highlight the potential selective advantages of a longer-term defensive strategy in management of oxidative stress (i.e., making microcystin) vs the shorter-term proactive strategy of producing cellular components to actively dissipate or degrade oxidative stress agents.","[Stark, Gwendolyn F.; Martin, Robbie M.; Smith, Laura E.; Wilhelm, Steven W.] Univ Tennessee, Dept Microbiol, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA; [Boyer, Gregory L.] SUNY, Dept Chem, Coll Environm Sci & Forestry, Syracuse, NY USA; [Hellweger, Ferdi L.] Tech Univ Berlin, Water Qual Engn, Berlin, Germany; [Bullerjahn, George S.] Bowling Green State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Bowling Green, OH USA; [Mckay, R.

To support broodstock management and selective breeding in cultured Pacific oysters (Crassostrea (Magallana) gigas), we developed an amplicon panel targeting 592 genomic regions and SNP variants with an average of 50 amplicons per chromosome. Target SNPs were selected based on elevated observed heterozygosity or differentiation in Pacific oyster populations in British Columbia, Canada. The use of the panel for parentage applications was evaluated using multiple generations of oysters from a breeding program on Vancouver Island, Canada (n = 181) and families selected for Ostreid herpesvirus-1 resistance from the Molluscan Broodstock Program in Oregon, USA (n = 136). Population characterization was evaluated using wild, naturalized, farmed, or hatchery oysters sampled throughout the Northern Hemisphere (n = 189). Technical replicates showed high genotype concordance (97.5%; n = 68 replicates). Parentage analysis found suspected pedigree and sample handling errors, demonstrating the panel's value for quality control in breeding programs. Suspected null alleles were identified and found to be largely population dependent, suggesting population-specific variation impacting target amplification. Null alleles were identified using existing data without the need for pedigree information, and once they were removed, assignment rates increased to 93.0 and 86.0% of possible assignments in the two breeding program datasets. A pipeline for analyzing the amplicon sequence data from sequencer output, amplitools, is also provided.","[Sutherland, Ben J.

Samples of larvae of Western Atlantic bluefin tuna Thunnus thynnus (Linnaeus, 1758) from standardized annual surveys in the northern Gulf of Mexico provide a potential source of offspring for close-kin mark-recapture (CKMR) estimates of abundance. However, the spatial patchiness and highly skewed numbers of larvae per tow suggest sampled larvae may come from a small number of parents, compromising the precision of CKMR. We used high throughput genomic profiling to study sibship within and among larval tows from the 2016 standardized Gulf-wide survey compared to targeted sampling carried out in 2017. Full- and half-siblings were found within both years, with 12% of 156 samples in 2016 and 56% of 317 samples in 2017 having at least one sibling. There were also two pairs of cross cohort half-siblings. Targeted sampling increased the number of larvae collected per sampling event but resulted in a higher proportion of siblings. The combined effective sample size across both years was about 75% of the nominal size, indicating that Gulf of Mexico larval collections could be a suitable source of juveniles for CKMR in Western Atlantic bluefin tuna.","[McDowell, Jan R.; Biesack, Ellen E.] William & Mary, Virginia Inst Marine Sci, Gloucester Point, VA 23062 USA; [Bravington, Mark; Grewe, Peter M.; Baylis, Shane M.; Davies, Campbell] CSIRO Oceans & Atmosphere, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [Lauretta, Matthew; Walter, John F.; Malca, Estrella; Gerard, Trika; Shiroza, Akihiro; Lamkin, John T.; Zapfe, Glenn; Ingram, Walter; Porch, Clay] NOAA, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Miami, FL 33149 USA; [Malca, Estrella; Shiroza, Akihiro] Univ Miami, Cooperat Inst Marine & Atmospher Studies, Miami, FL USA","William & Mary; Virginia Institute of Marine Science; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); CSIRO Oceans & Atmosphere; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of Miami","McDowell, JR (corresponding author), William & Mary, Virginia Inst Marine Sci, Gloucester Point, VA 23062 USA.;Bravington, M; Grewe, PM (corresponding author), CSIRO Oceans & Atmosphere, Hobart, Tas, Australia.;Lauretta, M (corresponding author), NOAA, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Miami, FL 33149 USA.","McDowell@VIMS.edu; Mark.Bravington@data61.csiro.au; Peter.Grewe@CSIRO.au; Matthew.Lauretta@noaa.gov","Zapfe, Glenn/KOD-8484-2024; Grewe, Peter/AAJ-5227-2021; Baylis, Shane/F-2459-2013; Malca, Estrella/D-7366-2012; Shirza, Akihiro/JOJ-9558-2023; Davies, Campbell/N-8086-2013","McDowell, Jan/0000-0002-4849-0649; Shiroza, Akihiro/0000-0001-7766-6829; Malca, Estrella/0000-0002-9182-5854","National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)'s RESTORE Science Program [NOAA-NOS-NCCOS-2017-2004875]; Cooperative Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Studies (CIMAS), a Cooperative Institute of the University of Miami [NA20OAR4320472]","National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)'s RESTORE Science Program; Cooperative Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Studies (CIMAS), a Cooperative Institute of the University of Miami","The authors would like to acknowledge funding from the Pew Charitable Trusts and the substantial efforts of numerous staff members, ship crew, students and volunteers who collected, processed, and prepared larvae for this Project.

The F. columnare type IX secretion system (T9SS) secretes many proteins and is required for virulence. The T9SS component GIdN is required for secretion and gliding motility over surfaces. Genetic manipulation of F. columnare is inefficient, which has impeded identification of secreted proteins that are critical for virulence. Here, we identified a virulent wild-type F. columnare strain (MS-FC-4) that is highly amenable to genetic manipulation. This facilitated isolation and characterization of two deletion mutants lacking core components of the T9SS. Deletion of gldN disrupted protein secretion and gliding motility and eliminated virulence in zebrafish and rainbow trout. Deletion of porV disrupted secretion and virulence but not motility. Both mutants exhibited decreased extracellular proteolytic, hemolytic, and chondroitin sulfate lyase activities. They also exhibited decreased biofilm formation and decreased attachment to fish fins and other surfaces. Using genomic and proteomic approaches, we identified proteins secreted by the T9SS. We deleted 10 genes encoding secreted proteins and characterized the virulence of mutants lacking individual or multiple secreted proteins. A mutant lacking two genes encoding predicted peptidases exhibited reduced virulence in rainbow trout, and mutants lacking a predicted cytolysin showed reduced virulence in zebrafish and rainbow trout. The results establish F. columnare strain MS-FC-4 as a genetically amenable model to identify virulence factors. This may aid development of measures to control columnaris disease and impact fish health and sustainable aquaculture. IMPORTANCE Flavobacterium columnare causes columnaris disease in wild and aquaculture-reared freshwater fish and is a major problem for aquaculture. Little is known regarding the virulence factors involved in this disease, and control measures are inadequate. The type IX secretion system (T9SS) secretes many proteins and is required for virulence, but the secreted virulence factors are not known. We identified a strain of F. columnare (MS-FC-4) that is well suited for genetic manipulation. The components of the T9SS and the proteins secreted by this system were identified. Deletion of core T9SS genes eliminated virulence. Genes encoding 10 secreted proteins were deleted. Deletion of two peptidase-encoding genes resulted in decreased virulence in rainbow trout, and deletion of a cytolysin-encoding gene resulted in decreased virulence in rainbow trout and zebrafish. Secreted peptidases and cytolysins are likely virulence factors and are targets for the development of control measures.","[Thunes, Nicole C.; Conrad, Rachel A.; Mohammed, Haitham H.; Zhu, Yongtao; Barbier, Paul; Schneider, John R.; Li, Nan; Erbes, Devon H.; McBride, Mark J.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Biol Sci, POB 413, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA; [Mohammed, Haitham H.] Assiut Univ, Fac Vet Med, Dept Aquat Anim Med & Management, Assiut, Egypt; [Zhu, Yongtao] Minnesota State Univ Mankato, Dept Biol Sci, Mankato, MN USA; [Evenhuis, Jason P.; Lipscomb, Ryan S.; Birkett, Clayton; Welch, Timothy J.] ARS, Natl Ctr Cool & Cold Water Aquaculture, USDA, Kearneysville, WV USA; [Perez-Pascual, David; Ghigo, Jean-Marc] Inst Pasteur, Genet Biofilms Lab, UMR CNRS2001, Paris, France; [Li, Nan] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Hydrobiol, State Key Lab Freshwater Ecol & Biotechnol, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China; [LaFrentz, Benjamin R.] USDA ARS, Aquat Anim Hlth Res Unit, Auburn, AL USA","University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Milwaukee; Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Assiut University; Minnesota State Colleges & Universities; Minnesota State University Mankato; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); Pasteur Network; Universite Paris Cite; Institut Pasteur Paris; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Hydrobiology, CAS; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)","McBride, MJ (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Biol Sci, POB 413, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA.","mcbride@uwm.edu","Perez-Pascual, David/F-3792-2015; Mohammed, Haitham/HNT-0464-2023; McBride, Mark/AAY-2490-2021; GHIGO, Jean-Marc/AAP-4011-2021","Mohammed, Haitham/0000-0002-0717-6055","United States Department of Agriculture-ARS CRIS project [5090-31320-004-00D, 5090-31320-004-03S, 58-5090-1-022]; National Science Foundation [MCB-1516990, NA18OAR4170097]; University of Wisconsin Sea Grant Institute under National Sea Grant College Program [R/SFA-20]; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration; U.S. Department of Commerce; State of Wisconsin; French government's Investissement d'Avenir Program, Laboratoire d'Excellence Integrative Biology of Emerging Infectious Diseases [ANR-10-LABX-62-IBEID]; Institut Carnot Pasteur MS fellowship","United States Department of Agriculture-ARS CRIS project; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); University of Wisconsin Sea Grant Institute under National Sea Grant College Program; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); U.S. Department of Commerce; State of Wisconsin; French government's Investissement d'Avenir Program, Laboratoire d'Excellence Integrative Biology of Emerging Infectious Diseases(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)); Institut Carnot Pasteur MS fellowship","This work was funded in part by United States Department of Agriculture-ARS CRIS project 5090-31320-004-00D and cooperative agreements 5090-31320-004-03S and 58-5090-1-022, National Science Foundation grant MCB-1516990 and grant NA18OAR4170097, and project R/SFA-20 from the University of Wisconsin Sea Grant Institute under grants from the National Sea Grant College Program, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, and the State of Wisconsin.

The cells are Gram-stain-negative, slightly curved motile rods (2-5x0.4-0.6 mu m) that bear a single polar flagellum and are capable of heterotrophic growth in a simple mineral medium supplemented with cellulose as a sole source of carbon and energy. Cellulose, carboxymethylcellulose, xylan, cellobiose and a variety of sugars also support growth. Strain Bs02(T) requires combined nitrogen for growth. Temperature, pH and salinity optima (range) for growth were 20 degrees C (range, 10-30 degrees C), 8.0 (pH 6.5-8.5) and 0.5 M NaCl (range, 0.0-0.8 M), respectively when grown on 0.5 % (w/v) galactose. Strain Bs02(T) does not require magnesium and calcium ion concentrations reflecting the proportions found in seawater. The genome size is approximately 4.03 Mbp and the DNA G+C content of the genome is 47.8 mol%. Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene sequences, and on conserved protein-coding sequences, show that strain Bs02(T) forms a well-supported clade with Teredinibacter turnerae. Average nucleotide identity and percentage of conserved proteins differentiate strain Bs02(T) from Teredinibacter turnerae at threshold values exceeding those proposed to distinguish bacterial species but not genera. These results indicate that strain Bs02(T) represents a novel species in the previously monotypic genus Teredinibacter for which the name Teredinibacter waterburyi sp. nov. is proposed.

Recent investigations have demonstrated that alterations in gene expression enable bivalves to respond to episodic low pH. Evidence generated from several studies highlighted the importance of upregulating genes related to biomineralization, ion transport, and acid-base balance such as carbonic anhydrase (CA) genes. Two experiments were designed to evaluate the effect of acidification on calcification processes and to probe the specific role of CA in oyster resilience to low pH. First, adult oysters were exposed to eight months of chronic acidification stress (pH similar to 7.3, pCO(2) similar to 3300 ppm) or control conditions (pH similar to 7.9, pCO(2) similar to 500 ppm) before shells were artificially damaged and shell repair monitored. Results showed a dramatic decrease in shell regeneration after chronic high pCO(2) exposure (only 30% of oysters regrew any shell) suggesting that mechanisms that promote calcification under high pCO(2) conditions may not be sustainable for extended periods of time. To further explore these mechanisms, a second experiment was designed by focusing on the role of CA in mitigating acidification stress. Here, adult oysters received an injection of acetazolamide in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to inhibit CA or DMSO (control) before rearing in control (pH similar to 8.1, pCO(2) similar to 340 ppm) or acidified (pH similar to 7.3, pCO(2) similar to 3300 ppm) conditions. After three weeks, oyster shells were damaged and shell repair monitored. Oysters incubated at low pH seawater with CA inhibition had the least amount of shell regeneration at the end of 21-day regrowth period. Interestingly, oysters were able to increase intracellular pH (pH(i)) of hemocytes under low pH conditions; however, this ability was significantly diminished with CA inhibition. Results highlight the role of CA in maintaining calcification under low pH conditions by establishing an intracellular environment favorable to calcium carbonate precipitation.","[Schwaner, Caroline; Barbosa, Michelle; Espinosa, Emmanuelle Pales; Allam, Bassem] SUNY Stony Brook, Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Stony Brook, NY 11790 USA","State University of New York (SUNY) System; Stony Brook University","Allam, B (corresponding author), SUNY Stony Brook, Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Stony Brook, NY 11790 USA.","bassem.allam@stonybrook.edu","","","New York Sea Grant program [R/XG-24, R/XG-33]; National Science Foundation [IOS 1656753]; Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission [19-0802]; Mid-Atlantic Sea Grant NOAA Ocean Acidification Program","New York Sea Grant program; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission; Mid-Atlantic Sea Grant NOAA Ocean Acidification Program","This research was supported by the New York Sea Grant program (projects R/XG-24 and R/XG-33) .

In the present article, we show increasing evidence that human activity also plays a disproportionate role in shaping the eco-evolutionary potential of systems-the likelihood of ecological change generating evolutionary change and vice versa. We suggest that the net outcome of human influences on trait change, ecology, and the feedback loops that link them will often (but not always) be to increase eco-evolutionary potential, with important consequences for stability and resilience of populations, communities, and ecosystems. We also integrate existing ecological and evolutionary metrics to predict and manage the eco-evolutionary dynamics of human-affected systems. To support this framework, we use a simple eco-evo feedback model to show that factors affecting eco-evolutionary potential are major determinants of eco-evolutionary dynamics. Our framework suggests that proper management of anthropogenic effects requires a science of human effects on eco-evolutionary potential.","[Wood, Zachary T.; Olsen, Brian J.; Kinnison, Michael T.] Univ Maine, Sch Biol & Ecol, Orono, ME 04469 USA; [Wood, Zachary T.; Olsen, Brian J.; Kinnison, Michael T.] Univ Maine, Maine Ctr Genet Environm, Orono, ME 04469 USA; [Palkovacs, Eric P.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Santa Cruz, CA USA","University of Maine System; University of Maine Orono; University of Maine System; University of Maine Orono; University of California System; University of California Santa Cruz","Wood, ZT (corresponding author), Univ Maine, Sch Biol & Ecol, Orono, ME 04469 USA.;Wood, ZT (corresponding author), Univ Maine, Maine Ctr Genet Environm, Orono, ME 04469 USA.","zachary.t.wood@maine.edu","Wood, Zachary/AAH-3650-2020","Wood, Zachary/0000-0001-7369-9199; Kinnison, Michael/0000-0003-4211-2118","US National Science Foundation [1457112, 1457333]; EPSCoR [1826777]; USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Hatch project through the Maine Agricultural and Forest Experiment Station (MAFES) [ME0-22207]; NOAA Cooperative Institute for Marine Ecosystems and Climate [3803 EPP]; Maine Center for Genetics in the Environment; Direct For Biological Sciences; Division Of Environmental Biology [1457112] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Office of Integrative Activities; Office Of The Director [1826777] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","US National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); EPSCoR(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Office of the Director (OD)NSF - Office of Integrative Activities (OIA)); USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Hatch project through the Maine Agricultural and Forest Experiment Station (MAFES); NOAA Cooperative Institute for Marine Ecosystems and Climate(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); Maine Center for Genetics in the Environment; Direct For Biological Sciences; Division Of Environmental Biology(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)); Office of Integrative Activities; Office Of The Director(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Office of the Director (OD)NSF - Office of Integrative Activities (OIA))","This work was funded by the US National Science Foundation (DEB grants no.1457112 and no.1457333 and EPSCoR grant no.1826777) and by the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Hatch project no.

The systematic complexity and taxonomic diversity of the zooplankton assemblage has presented significant challenges for routine morphological (microscopic) identification of species in samples collected during ecosystem monitoring and fisheries management surveys. Metabarcoding using the mitochondrial Cytochrome Oxidase I (COI) gene region has shown promise for detecting and identifying species of some - but not all - taxonomic groups in samples of marine zooplankton. This study examined species diversity of zooplankton on the Northwest Atlantic Continental Shelf using 27 samples collected in 2002-2012 from the Gulf of Maine, Georges Bank, and Mid-Atlantic Bight during Ecosystem Monitoring (EcoMon) Surveys by the NOAA NMFS Northeast Fisheries Science Center. COI metabarcodes were identified using the MetaZooGene Barcode Atlas and Database (https://metazoogene.org/MZGdb) specific to the North Atlantic Ocean. A total of 181 species across 23 taxonomic groups were detected, including a number of sibling and cryptic species that were not discriminated by morphological taxonomic analysis of EcoMon samples. In all, 67 species of 15 taxonomic groups had >= 50 COI sequences; 23 species had >1,000 COI sequences. Comparative analysis of molecular and morphological data showed significant correlations between COI sequence numbers and microscopic counts for 5 of 6 taxonomic groups and for 5 of 7 species with >1,000 COI sequences for which both types of data were available. Multivariate statistical analysis showed clustering of samples within each region based on both COI sequence numbers and EcoMon counts, although differences among the three regions were not statistically significant. The results demonstrate the power and potential of COI metabarcoding for identification of species of metazoan zooplankton in the context of ecosystem monitoring.","","","","","Questel, Jennifer/HKW-8698-2023; Richardson, David/A-3331-2008; Batta-Lona, Paola G/B-7848-2016","Bucklin, Ann/0000-0003-3750-9348; Batta-Lona, Paola G/0000-0002-6477-6110; Wiebe, Peter/0000-0002-6059-4651","NOAA Northeast Fisheries Science Center; Ecosystem Monitoring (EcoMon) Program of NW Atlantic continental shelf; (Narragansett, RI, USA); Scientific Committee on Oceanic Research (SCOR) Working Group [157]; Working Group on Integrated Morphological and Molecular Taxonomy (WGIMT); International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES); Scientific Committee on Oceanic Research (SCOR); U.S. National Science Foundation [157]; national SCOR committees; [OCE-1840868]","NOAA Northeast Fisheries Science Center(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); Ecosystem Monitoring (EcoMon) Program of NW Atlantic continental shelf; (Narragansett, RI, USA); Scientific Committee on Oceanic Research (SCOR) Working Group; Working Group on Integrated Morphological and Molecular Taxonomy (WGIMT); International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES); Scientific Committee on Oceanic Research (SCOR); U.S. National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); national SCOR committees;","This publication resulted in part from support provided by the Scientific Committee on Oceanic Research (SCOR).

Machine learning pattern recognition and sensitivity analysis were employed to examine metabolomic small molecule profiles and transcriptomic gene expression data generated from liver and white skeletal muscle of hybrid striped bass (white bass Morone chrysops x striped bass M. saxatilis) representative of the top and bottom 10 % by body size of a production cohort. Results Larger fish (good-growth) had significantly greater weight, total length, hepatosomatic index, and specific growth rate compared to smaller fish (poor-growth) and also had significantly more muscle fibers of smaller diameter (<= 20 mu m diameter), indicating active hyperplasia. Differences in metabolomic pathways included enhanced energetics (glycolysis, citric acid cycle) and amino acid metabolism in good-growth fish, and enhanced stress, muscle inflammation (cortisol, eicosanoids) and dysfunctional liver cholesterol metabolism in poor-growth fish. The majority of gene transcripts identified as differentially expressed between groups were down-regulated in good-growth fish. Several molecules associated with important growth-regulatory pathways were up-regulated in muscle of fish that grew poorly: growth factors including agt and agtr2 (angiotensins), nicotinic acid (which stimulates growth hormone production), gadd45b, rgl1, zfp36, cebpb, and hmgb1; insulin-like growth factor signaling (igfbp1 and igf1); cytokine signaling (socs3, cxcr4); cell signaling (rgs13, rundc3a), and differentiation (rhou, mmp17, cd22, msi1); mitochondrial uncoupling proteins (ucp3, ucp2); and regulators of lipid metabolism (apoa1, ldlr). Growth factors pttg1, egfr, myc, notch1, and sirt1 were notably up-regulated in muscle of good-growing fish. Conclusion A combinatorial pathway analysis using metabolomic and transcriptomic data collectively suggested promotion of cell signaling, proliferation, and differentiation in muscle of good-growth fish, whereas muscle inflammation and apoptosis was observed in poor-growth fish, along with elevated cortisol (an anti-inflammatory hormone), perhaps related to muscle wasting, hypertrophy, and inferior growth. These findings provide important biomarkers and mechanisms by which growth is regulated in fishes and other vertebrates as well.","[Rajab, Sarah A.

With populations on the decline worldwide, freshwater mussels are of conservation concern. In this study, we explore the propensity of the invasive Round Goby (Neogobius melanostomus) fish to prey upon indigenous freshwater mussels. First, we conducted lab experiments where Round Gobies were given the opportunity to feed on juvenile unionid mussels and macroinvertebrates, revealing rates and preferences of consumption. Several Round Gobies consumed whole freshwater mussels during these experiments, as confirmed by mussel counts and x-ray images of the fishes. Next, we investigated Round Gobies collected from stream habitats of the French Creek watershed, which is renowned for its unique and rich aquatic biodiversity. We developed a novel DNA metabarcoding method to identify the specific species of mussels consumed by Round Goby and provide a new database of DNA gene sequences for 25 indigenous unionid mussel species. Several of the fishes sampled had consumed indigenous mussels, including the Elktoe (non-endangered), Creeper (non-endangered), Long Solid (state endangered), and Rayed Bean (federally endangered) species. The invasive Round Goby poses a growing threat to unionid mussels, including species of conservation concern. The introduction of the invasive Round Goby to freshwaters of North America is shaping ecosystem transitions within the aquatic critical zone having widespread implications for conservation and management.","[Clark, Kyle H.; Mueller, Sara J.; Wisor, Joshua M.; Stauffer, J.

Xc) system, the Ca. Xc bacterium infects abalone digestive tissues and leads to extreme starvation and a characteristic withering  of the gastropod foot. First identified in black abalone in California after an El Nino event, withering syndrome (WS) has caused large declines in wild black and captive white abalone on the northeastern Pacific coast, but disease resistance levels are species-, and possibly population-specific. This study compared gene expression patterns in the digestive gland of Ca. Xc-exposed and unexposed (control) Pinto abalone (Haliotis kamtschatkana), a particularly susceptible species. Lab-induced Ca. Xc infections were followed over 7 months and RNAseq was used to identify differential gene expression. Exposed Pinto abalone showed distinct changes in expression of 68 genes at 3 and 7 months post-infection relative to those in control animals. Upregulation of an orexin-like receptor (which is involved in feeding signaling) and a zinc peptidase-like region (many amino peptidases are zinc peptidases) in animals infected for 7 months indicates that animals with Ca. Xc infection may be starving and upregulating processes associated with feeding and digestion. Other groups of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were upregulated or downregulated across control and exposed individuals over the 7-month experiment, including DEG groups that likely correspond to early disease state and to general stress response of being held in captivity. No patterns emerged in genes known to be involved in molluscan immune response, despite this being an expectation during a 7-month infection; digestion-related genes and unannotated DEGs were identified as targets for future research on potential immune response to WS in abalone.","[Frederick, Alyssa R.; Heras, Joseph; German, Donovan P.] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 321 Steinhaus Hall, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Friedman, Carolyn S.] Univ Washington, Sch Aquat & Fishery Sci, Box 355020, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Frederick, Alyssa R.] Univ Calif Davis, Bodega Marine Lab, POB 247,2099 Westshore Rd, Bodega Bay, CA 94923 USA; [Heras, Joseph] Calif State Univ San Bernardino, Dept Biol, 5500 Univ Pkwy, San Bernardino, CA 92407 USA","University of California System; University of California Irvine; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; University of California System; University of California Davis; California State University System; California State University San Bernardino","Frederick, AR (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Bodega Marine Lab, POB 247,2099 Westshore Rd, Bodega Bay, CA 94923 USA.","alyssarfrederick@gmail.com; carolynf@uw.edu; dgerman@uci.edu","","","Sage Audubon Society Bloom-Hays Grant; University of California Irvine OCEANS Graduate Student Fellowship; University of California Irvine's Newkirk Center for Science and Society; National Oceanic and Atmo-spheric Administration [NA14NMF4690293]; School of Aquatic & Fishery Sciences, University of Washington; Western Society of Malacologists Research Grant; National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship [DGE-1321846]","Sage Audubon Society Bloom-Hays Grant; University of California Irvine OCEANS Graduate Student Fellowship; University of California Irvine's Newkirk Center for Science and Society; National Oceanic and Atmo-spheric Administration(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); School of Aquatic & Fishery Sciences, University of Washington(University of Washington); Western Society of Malacologists Research Grant; National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship(National Science Foundation (NSF))","This work was supported by a Sea and Sage Audubon Society Bloom-Hays Grant (ARF) ; University of California Irvine OCEANS Graduate Student Fellowship (ARF) ; University of California Irvine's Newkirk Center for Science and Society (ARF) ; the National Oceanic and Atmo-spheric Administration Grant No. NA14NMF4690293 to C.

These materials were characterized using genetic, metabolomic (1H-NMR, nuclear magnetic resonance and LC-HRMS/MS, liquid chromatography high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry), lipidomic, and proteomic methods to explore their use as matrix-matched, multi-omic differential materials for method development towards identifying product source and/or as quality control in untargeted omics studies. The results from experimental replicates were reproducible for each reference material and analytical method, with the most abundant features reported. Additionally, differences between the materials could be detected, where wild-caught and aquacultured seafood could be distinguished using untargeted metabolite, lipid, and protein analyses. Further processing of the fresh-frozen RMs by freeze-drying revealed the freeze-dried seafoods could still be reliably discerned. These results demonstrate the usefulness of these reference materials as tools for omics instrument validation and measurement harmonization in seafood-related studies. Furthermore, their use as differential quality control (QC) materials, regardless of preparation method, may also provide a tool for laboratories to demonstrate proficiency at discriminating between products based on source/species.","[Ellisor, Debra L.; Bayless, Amanda L.; Schock, Tracey B.; Davis, W.

The chelonian shell is a remarkable evolutionary adaptation, facilitating success in terrestrial, freshwater and marine ecosystems. Today, more than half of the 360 living species and 482 total taxa (species and subspecies combined) are threatened with extinction. This places chelonians among the groups with the highest extinction risk of any sizeable vertebrate group. Turtle populations are declining rapidly due to habitat loss, consumption by humans for food and traditional medicines and collection for the international pet trade. Many taxa could become extinct in this century. Here, we examine survival threats to turtles and tortoises and discuss the interventions that will be needed to prevent widespread extinction in this group in coming decades.","[Stanford, Craig B.] Univ Southern Calif, Dept Biol Sci, Los Angeles, CA 90007 USA; [Stanford, Craig B.] Los Angeles Nat Hist Museum, Herpetol Sect, Los Angeles, CA 90007 USA; [Iverson, John B.] Earlham Coll, Dept Biol, Richmond, IN 47374 USA; [Rhodin, Anders G.

Although the potential impacts of environment on gene products are myriad, important phenotypic responses are often regulated by a few key points in metabolic networks where externally supplied resources or physiological substrates limit reaction kinetics. Environmental resources commonly limiting seagrass productivity, survival, and growth include light, temperature, and CO(2)availability that control carbon assimilation and sucrose formation, and regulate stress responses to environmental change. Here I present a systems approach to quantify the responses of seagrasses to shifts in environmental factors that control fundamental physiological processes and whole plant performance in the context of a changing climate. This review shows that our ability to understand the past and predict the future trajectory of seagrass-based ecosystems can benefit from a mechanistic understanding of the responses of these remarkable plants to the simultaneous impacts of ocean acidification, climate warming, and eutrophication that are altering ecosystem function across the globe.","[Zimmerman, Richard C.] Old Dominion Univ, Dept Ocean Earth & Atmospher Sci, Norfolk, VA 23529 USA","Old Dominion University","Zimmerman, RC (corresponding author), Old Dominion Univ, Dept Ocean Earth & Atmospher Sci, Norfolk, VA 23529 USA.","rzimmerm@odu.edu","Zimmerman, Richard/GLT-9568-2022","","National Science Foundation [OCE-1635403]; Ocean Biology and Biogeochemistry Program of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration [NNX17AH01G]; Ocean Acidification Program of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration [NA18NOS4780177]","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Ocean Biology and Biogeochemistry Program of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration; Ocean Acidification Program of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA)","Financial support for the preparation of this manuscript was provided by the National Science Foundation (OCE-1635403), the Ocean Biology and Biogeochemistry Program of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NNX17AH01G), and the Ocean Acidification Program of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NA18NOS4780177).",NA,139,16,23,4,53,"SPRINGER","NEW YORK","ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES","1559-2723","1559-2731","","ESTUAR COAST","Estuaries Coasts","MAR",2021,44,"2",NA,"","SI","",558,576,"","10.1007/s12237-020-00837-7","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12237-020-00837-7",NA,"OCT 2020",19,"Environmental Sciences; Marine & Freshwater Biology","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology","PX7PE",NA,"","","","2024-10-25","WOS:000578470300002","View Full Record in Web of Science",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Theoretical studies suggest that when gene flow is high, clustering of adaptive genes in fewer genomic regions would protect adaptive alleles from recombination and thus be selected for, but few studies have tested it with empirical data. Here, we used restriction site-associated sequencing to generate genomic data for six fish species with contrasting life histories from six reaches of the Upper Mississippi River System, USA. We used four differentiation-based outlier tests and three genotype-environment association analyses to define neutral single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and outlier SNPs that were putatively under selection. We then examined the distribution of outlier SNPs along the genome and investigated whether these SNPs were found in genomic islands of differentiation and inversions. We found that gene flow varied among species, and outlier SNPs were clustered more tightly in species with higher gene flow. The two species with the highest overall F-ST (0.0303-0.0720) and therefore lowest gene flow showed little evidence of clusters of outlier SNPs, with outlier SNPs in these species spreading uniformly across the genome. In contrast, nearly all outlier SNPs in the species with the lowest F-ST (0.0003) were found in a single large putative inversion. Two other species with intermediate gene flow (F-ST similar to 0.0025-0.0050) also showed clustered genomic architectures, with most islands of differentiation clustered on a few chromosomes. Our results provide important empirical evidence to support the hypothesis that increasingly clustered architecture of local adaptation is associated with high gene flow.","[Shi, Yue; Dokai, William; McPhee, Megan V.] Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Coll Fisheries & Ocean Sci, Juneau, AK 99775 USA; [Shi, Yue; Dokai, William] Univ Wisconsin, Coll Nat Resources, Wisconsin Cooperat Fishery Res Unit, Stevens Point, WI USA; [Bouska, Kristen L.] US Geol Survey, Upper Midwest Environm Sci Ctr, La Crosse, WI USA; [McKinney, Garrett J.] Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, NRC Res Associateship Program, Northwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, NOAA, Seattle, WA 98115 USA; [Bartels, Andrew] Wisconsin Dept Nat Resources, Long Term Resource Monitoring Program, La Crosse, WI USA; [Larson, Wesley A.] Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, NOAA, Auke Bay Labs, Alaska Fisheries Sci Ctr, Juneau, AK USA; [Larson, Wesley A.] Univ Wisconsin, US Geol Survey, Wisconsin Cooperat Fishery Res Unit, Coll Nat Resources, Stevens Point, WI 54481 USA","University of Alaska System; University of Alaska Fairbanks; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Stevens Point; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Stevens Point; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey","Shi, Y (corresponding author), Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Coll Fisheries & Ocean Sci, Juneau, AK 99775 USA.","yshi8@alaska.edu","Bouska, Kristen/J-6976-2019; Shi, Yue/AAD-7368-2021","McPhee, Megan/0000-0001-9614-4137; Bouska, Kristen/0000-0002-4115-2313; Larson, Wesley/0000-0003-4473-3401; Shi, Yue/0000-0002-2860-2666","U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Upper Mississippi River Restoration Program [96514790661277]","U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Upper Mississippi River Restoration Program","U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Upper Mississippi River Restoration Program, Grant/Award Number: 96514790661277",NA,80,12,12,1,29,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","0962-1083","1365-294X","","MOL ECOL","Mol.

A population of the pathogenic bacterium Vibrio vulnificus lives in the estuarine Ala Wai Canal in Honolulu which surrounds the heavily populated tourism center of Waikiki. We developed a statistical model to predict V. vulnificus dynamics in this system using environmental measurements from moored oceanographic and atmospheric sensors in real time. During a year-long investigation, we analyzed water from 9 sampling events at 3 depths and 8 sites along the canal (n = 213) for 36 biogeochemical variables and V. vulnificus concentration using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) of the hemolysin A gene (vvhA). The best multiple linear regression model of V. vulnificus concentration, explaining 80% of variation, included only six predictors: 5-day average rainfall preceding water sampling, daily maximum air temperature, water temperature, nitrate plus nitrite, and two metrics of humic dissolved organic matter (DOM). We show how real-time predictions of V. vulnificus concentration can be made using these models applied to the time series of water quality measurements from the Pacific Islands Ocean Observing System (PacIOOS) as well as the PacIOOS plume model based on the Waikiki Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) products. These applications highlight the importance of including DOM variables in predictive modeling of V. vulnificus and the influence of rain events in elevating nearshore concentrations of V. vulnificus. Long-term climate model projections of locally downscaled monthly rainfall and air temperature were used to predict an overall increase in V. vulnificus concentration of approximately 2-to 3-fold by 2100. Improving these predictive models of microbial populations is critical for management of waterborne pathogen risk exposure, particularly in the wake of a changing global climate.","[Bullington, Jessica A.; Steward, Grieg F.; McManus, Margaret A.; Neuheimer, Anna B.; Glazer, Brian T.; Nelson, Craig E.] Univ Hawaii M anoa, Dept Oceanog, Honolulu, HI USA; [Bullington, Jessica A.; Golder, Abigail R.; Steward, Grieg F.; Nelson, Craig E.] Daniel K Inouye Ctr Microbial Oceanography: Res &, Honolulu, HI USA; [Bullington, Jessica A.; Nelson, Craig E.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Sea Grant Coll Program, Honolulu, HI USA; [Golder, Abigail R.] Virginia Inst Marine Sci, Dept Biol Sci, Gloucester Point, VA USA; [Neuheimer, Anna B.] Aarhus Univ, Dept Biol, Aarhus, Denmark; [Nigro, Olivia D.] Hawaii Pacific Univ, Dept Nat Sci, Honolulu, HI USA","University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; William & Mary; Virginia Institute of Marine Science; Aarhus University; Hawaii Pacific University","Bullington, JA (corresponding author), Univ Hawaii M anoa, Dept Oceanog, Honolulu, HI USA.;Bullington, JA (corresponding author), Daniel K Inouye Ctr Microbial Oceanography: Res &, Honolulu, HI USA.;Bullington, JA (corresponding author), Univ Hawaii Manoa, Sea Grant Coll Program, Honolulu, HI USA.","jbulling@hawaii.edu","Steward, Grieg/D-9768-2011; Nelson, Craig/H-3323-2019; Neuheimer, Anna/Q-3023-2017","Nelson, Craig/0000-0003-2525-3496","University of Hawai.i at Manoa SMART Ala Wai Program (Strategic Monitoring and Resilience Training in the Ala Wai Watershed); National Science Foundation [OCE1737357, OCE1949033]; UH Microbial Genomics and Analytical Lab - NIH COBRE P20 [GM125508]; Aarhus University Research Foundation; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration - University of Hawai'i Sea Grant College Program, SOEST; NOAA Office of Sea Grant, Department of Commerce [NA18OAR4170076]","University of Hawai.i at Manoa SMART Ala Wai Program (Strategic Monitoring and Resilience Training in the Ala Wai Watershed); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); UH Microbial Genomics and Analytical Lab - NIH COBRE P20; Aarhus University Research Foundation; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration - University of Hawai'i Sea Grant College Program, SOEST; NOAA Office of Sea Grant, Department of Commerce(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA)","This work was supported by the University of Hawai.i at Manoa SMART Ala Wai Program (Strategic Monitoring and Resilience Training in the Ala Wai Watershed), the National Science Foundation (OCE1737357; OCE1949033), the UH Microbial Genomics and Analytical Lab sponsored by NIH COBRE P20 (GM125508), an Aarhus University Research Foundation Starting Grant to A.B.N., and a grant/cooperative agreement from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Project R/HE35, which is sponsored by the University ofHawai`i Sea Grant College Program, SOEST, under Institutional Grant No. NA18OAR4170076 from NOAA Office of Sea Grant, Department of Commerce.

The extent to which Dinophysis relies on exogenous N and the specific biochemical pathways important for supporting its autotrophic and heterotrophic growth are unknown. Here, the nutritional ecology of Dinophysis was explored using two approaches: 1) 15N tracer experiments were conducted to quantify the concentrationdependent uptake rates and associated kinetics of various N compounds (nitrate, ammonium, urea) of Dinophysis cultures and 2) the transcriptomic responses of Dinophysis cultures grown with multiple combinations of prey and nutrients were assessed via dinoflagellate spliced leader-based transcriptome profiling. Of the N compounds examined, ammonium had the highest Vmax and affinity coefficient, and lowest Ks for both pre-starved and prefed cultures, collectively demonstrating the preference of Dinophysis for this N source while little-to-no nitrate uptake was observed. During the transcriptome experiments, Dinophysis grown with nitrate and without prey had the largest number of genes with lower transcript abundances, did not increase abundance of transcripts associated with nitrate/nitrite uptake or reduction, and displayed no cellular growth, suggesting D. acuminata is not capable of growing on nitrate. When offered prey, the transcriptomic response of Dinophysis included the production of phagolysosomes, enzymes involved in protein and lipid catabolism, and N acquisition through amino acid degradation pathways. Compared with cultures only offered ammonium or prey, cultures offered both ammonium and prey had the largest number of genes with increased transcript abundances, the highest growth rate, and the unique activation of multiple pathways involved in cellular catabolism, further evidencing the ability of Dinophysis to grow optimally as a mixotroph. Collectively, this study evidences the key role ammonium plays in the mixotrophic growth of Dinophysis and reveals the precise biochemical pathways that facilitate its mixotrophic growth.","[Hattenrath-Lehmann, Theresa K.; Nanjappa, Deepak; Goleski, Jennifer A.; Gobler, Christopher J.] SUNY Stony Brook, Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, 239 Montauk Hwy, Southampton, NY 11968 USA; [Zhang, Huan; Lin, Senjie] Univ Connecticut, Dept Marine Sci, Groton, CT 06340 USA; [Yu, Liying; Lin, Senjie] Xiamen Univ, State Key Lab Marine Environm Sci & Marine Biodiv, Xiamen 361101, Peoples R China; [Yu, Liying; Lin, Senjie] Xiamen Univ, Global Change Res Ctr, Xiamen 361101, Peoples R China; [Hattenrath-Lehmann, Theresa K.] New York State Dept Hlth, Wadsworth Ctr, Empire Plaza, Albany, NY 12223 USA","State University of New York (SUNY) System; Stony Brook University; University of Connecticut; Xiamen University; Xiamen University; State University of New York (SUNY) System; Wadsworth Center","Gobler, CJ (corresponding author), SUNY Stony Brook, Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, 239 Montauk Hwy, Southampton, NY 11968 USA.","christopher.gobler@stonybrook.edu","Lin, Senjie/A-7466-2011; Nanjappa, Deepak/AAX-2176-2020","","National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science Competitive Research Program [NA17NOS4780184, NA19NOS4780182]","National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science Competitive Research Program(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA)","Partial support for this research was received from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science Competitive Research Program under awards NA17NOS4780184 and NA19NOS4780182 to CJG.

Through the actions of their main secretory products, Prl cells play a key role in supporting hydromineral balance of fishes by controlling the major osmoregulatory organs (ie, gill, intestine and kidney). The release of Prl from isolated cells of the rostral pars distalis (RPD) occurs in direct response to physiologically relevant reductions in extracellular osmolality. Although the particular signal transduction pathways that link osmotic conditions to Prl secretion have been identified, the processes that underlie hyposmotic induction ofprlgene expression remain unknown. In this short review, we describe two distinct tilapia gene loci that encode Prl(177)and Prl(188). From our in silico analyses ofprl(177)andprl(188)promoter regions (approximately 1000 bp) and a transcriptome analysis of RPDs from fresh water (FW)- and seawater (SW)-acclimated tilapia, we propose a working model for how multiple transcription factors link osmoreceptive processes with adaptive patterns ofprl(177)andprl(188)gene expression. We confirmed via RNA-sequencing and a quantitative polymerase chain reaction that multiple transcription factors emerging as predicted regulators ofprlgene expression are expressed in the RPD of tilapia. In particular, gene transcripts encodingpou1f1,stat3,creb3l1, pbxip1aandstat1awere highly expressed;creb3l1, pbxip1aandstat1awere elevated in fish acclimated to SW vs FW. Combined, our in silico and transcriptome analyses set a path for resolving how adaptive patterns of Prl secretion are achieved via the integration of osmoreceptive processes with the control ofprlgene transcription.","[Seale, Andre P.; Malintha, Gardi Hewage Tharindu; Celino-Brady, Fritzie T.; Head, Tony; Stoytcheva, Zoia R.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Human Nutr Food & Anim Sci, 1955 East West Rd, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Belcaid, Mahdi] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Hawaii Inst Marine Biol, Kaneohe, HI USA; [Yamaguchi, Yoko] Shimane Univ, Acad Assembly, Inst Agr & Life Sci, Matsue, Shimane, Japan; [Lerner, Darren T.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Univ Hawaii Sea Grant Coll Program, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Baltzegar, David A.] North Carolina State Univ, Genom Sci Lab, Off Res & Innovat, Raleigh, NC USA; [Borski, Russell J.] North Carolina State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Raleigh, NC USA; [Breves, Jason P.] Skidmore Coll, Dept Biol, Saratoga Springs, NY 12866 USA","University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; Shimane University; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; North Carolina State University; North Carolina State University; Skidmore College","Seale, AP (corresponding author), Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Human Nutr Food & Anim Sci, 1955 East West Rd, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.","seale@hawaii.edu","","Baltzegar, David/0000-0002-3467-4017; Yamaguchi, Yoko/0000-0002-0526-0069; Seale, Andre/0000-0003-2398-4201","National Science Foundation [IOS-1755016, IOS-1755131, IOS-1457040]; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration [NA18OAR4170347]; National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases [1R21DK111775-01]; National Institute of Food and Agriculture [HAW02051-H]; Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program in the Office of the Vice-Chancellor for Research at the University of Hawai'i at Manoa; Edwin W.

Coupled with microbial community analysis, untargeted metabolomics of environmental samples using high resolution tandem mass spectrometry provides unprecedented access to the unique specialized metabolisms of these chemosynthetic microorganisms. In addition, the diverse microbial natural products are of broad interest due to their potential applications for human and environmental health and well-being. In this exploratory study, sediment cores were collected from two methane seeps (-1000 m water depth) with very different gross geomorphologies, as well as a non-seep control site. Cores were subjected to parallel metabolomic and microbial community analyses to assess the feasibility of representative metabolite detection and identify congruent patterns between metabolites and microbes. Metabolomes generated using high resolution liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry were annotated with predicted structure classifications of the majority of mass features using SIRIUS and CANOPUS. The microbiome was characterized by analysis of 16S rRNA genes and analyzed both at the whole community level, as well as the small subgroup of Actinobacteria, which are known to produce societally useful compounds. Overall, the younger Dagorlad seep possessed a greater abundance of metabolites while there was more variation in abundance, number, and distribution of metabolites between samples at the older Emyn Muil seep. Lipid and lipid-like molecules displayed the greatest variation between sites and accounted for a larger proportion of metabolites found at the older seep. Overall, significant differences in composition of the microbial community mirrored the patterns of metabolite diversity within the samples; both varied greatly as a function of distance from methane seep, indicating a deterministic role of seepage. Interdisciplinary research to understand microbial and metabolic diversity is essential for understanding the processes and role of ubiquitous methane seeps in global systems and here we increase understanding of these systems by visualizing some of the chemical diversity that seeps add to marine systems.","[Redick, Margaret A.; Neuhaus, George F.; Mcphail, Kerry L.] Oregon State Univ, Coll Pharm, Dept Pharmaceut Sci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Cummings, Milo E.; Thurber, Andrew R.] Oregon State Univ, Coll Sci, Dept Microbiol, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Bellucci, Lila M.

This G3 generation was cultured under non-quarantine conditions and families were planted at sub-tidal and inter-tidal test sites, in Oregon and California, respectively. Field performance traits were measured to determine the potential for improvement through selection. Overall, Midori oysters showed significantly lower values for harvest yield, survival, individual average weight and dry meat weight compared with oysters from a selected stock of the Miyagi strain of Pacific oyster; however, shell shape index (a measure of shell depth) was significantly greater in Midori oysters. Heritability estimates for group traits at harvest (survival, yield and individual average harvest weight) were high, whereas heritability estimates for individual traits (individual weight, wet meat weight and dry meat weight) and for shell dimension measurements (shell length, shell width and shell depth) were moderate-to-high. Family-by-site (GxE) correlations were low-to-moderate for all measured traits. Genetic correlations were positive and moderate-to-high among group traits and shell dimensions. In contrast, correlations between shell shape and other traits had small-to-moderate negative values but these were not statistically significant. Estimated potential genetic gain for dry meat weight was high (46%) whereas estimated gains for yield, individual average weight, individual weight were high-to-moderate (approximately 10%). In contrast, shell shape showed very little potential for genetic gain through selection. Overall, the Midori strain of the Pacific oyster shows promise as a deep-cupped oyster for the half-shell trade. Statement of relevance: We describe the introduction of a new strain of Pacific oyster (Midori) collected from southern Japan to the US West Coast. Rigorous quarantine protocols and disease tests were applied to ensure that the risks of introducing diseases were minimized. The Midori strain was found to have a deeper cup than the commonly farmed Miyagi strain but the potential estimated gain for improving this trait through selection was small.","[de Melo, Claudio Manoel Rodrigues] Univ Fed Santa Catarina, Dept Aquaculture, Lab Marine Mollusks, BR-88061600 Florianopolis, SC, Brazil; [Divilov, Konstantin; Schoolfield, Blaine; Evans, Ford; Langdon, Chris] Oregon State Univ, Hatfield Marine Sci Ctr, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife, Coastal Oregon Marine Expt Stn, 2030 SE Marine Sci Dr, Newport, OR 97365 USA; [Durland, Evan] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Marine Sci, Tjarno, Sweden; [Davis, Joth] Baywater Shellfish Farms, Bainbridge Isl, WA 98110 USA; [Carnegie, Ryan B.; Reece, Kimberly S.] William & Mary, Virginia Inst Marine Sci, POB 1346, Gloucester Point, VA 23062 USA","Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina (UFSC); Oregon State University; University of Gothenburg; William & Mary; Virginia Institute of Marine Science","de Melo, CMR (corresponding author), Univ Fed Santa Catarina, Dept Aquaculture, Lab Marine Mollusks, BR-88061600 Florianopolis, SC, Brazil.","claudio.melo@ufsc.br","Durland, Evan/AAQ-4619-2021; Melo, Claudio/G-4486-2012","Reece, Kimberly/0000-0002-1751-1566; Carnegie, Ryan/0009-0001-8667-4270","CNPq; National Council for Scientific and Technological Development-Brazil; Molluscan Broodstock Program (MBP); USDA/NIFA; NOAA; State of Oregon; Virginia Institute of Marine Science Technical assistance; USDA/ARS Shellfish Genetics program at the Hatfield Marine Science Center; Taylor Shellfish Farms Inc.","CNPq(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); National Council for Scientific and Technological Development-Brazil(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); Molluscan Broodstock Program (MBP); USDA/NIFA(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)); NOAA(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); State of Oregon; Virginia Institute of Marine Science Technical assistance; USDA/ARS Shellfish Genetics program at the Hatfield Marine Science Center; Taylor Shellfish Farms Inc.","Contributions by Claudio de Melo were supported by a scholarship from CNPq, National Council for Scientific and Technological Development-Brazil.

The dominant fish species in the Chukchi Sea is Arctic Cod (Boreogadus saida); however, other gadids such as Saffron Cod (Eleginus gracilis), Pacific Cod (Gadus macrocephalus) and Walleye Pollock (Gadus chalcogrammus) have been observed. Two aims in this study were to evaluate the accuracy of at sea morphological identification (which can be difficult for juveniles) with genetic species identification and to document potential variation in species composition and distribution of gadids in the Pacific Arctic in response to changing environmental conditions. Microsatellite and mtDNA genetic results revealed that most B. saida collected in the Chukchi Sea in 2012 and 2013 were correctly identified at sea. Conversely, genetic results from samples collected in 2017 and 2019 revealed a large number of G. chalcogrammus and some G. macrocephalus and E. gracilis that were initially identified at sea as B. saida. The majority of misidentification occurred between B. saida and G. chalcogrammus. This study indicates a northward shift of G. chalcogrammus and B. saida during warmer conditions. In addition, juvenile Polar Cod (A. glacialis), which is not typically found in the Chukchi Sea and was not identified at sea, was genetically detected on 3 hauls on the northern Chukchi Shelf, outside of its documented distribution. Accurate species identification, especially during a time of changing marine landscapes, is not only important for survey abundance estimates but for downstream analyses as well. This emphasizes the value of implementing strategies for correct identification of the gadid species to better capture and monitor responses to varying and likely changing conditions. Our results provide strong evidence of distributional shifts and range expansions of gadid species in the Arctic, which may be the result of changing climactic conditions.","[Wildes, Sharon; Whittle, Jackie; Nguyen, Hanhvan; Marsh, Maxwell; Karpan, Kirby; 'Amelio, Catherine; Dimond, Andrew; Cieciel, Kristin; Larson, Wes; Guyon, Jeff] Alaska Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Juneau, AK USA; [De Robertis, Alex] Alaska Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Seattle, WA USA; [Levine, Robert] Univ Washington, Sch Oceanog, Seattle, WA USA; [Wildes, Sharon] Alaska Fisheries Sci Ctr, Auke Bay Labs, 17109 Pt Lena Loop Rd, Juneau, AK 99801 USA","National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA","Wildes, S (corresponding author), Alaska Fisheries Sci Ctr, Auke Bay Labs, 17109 Pt Lena Loop Rd, Juneau, AK 99801 USA.","Sharon.wildes@noaa.gov","","Wildes, Sharon/0000-0002-4302-3195","North Pacific Research Board Arctic Integrated Ecosystem Research Program; Arctic Integrated Ecosystem Research Program; North Pacific Research Board; Bureau of Ocean Energy Management; Collaborative Alaskan Arctic Studies Program; Office of Naval Research","North Pacific Research Board Arctic Integrated Ecosystem Research Program; Arctic Integrated Ecosystem Research Program; North Pacific Research Board; Bureau of Ocean Energy Management; Collaborative Alaskan Arctic Studies Program; Office of Naval Research(United States Department of DefenseUnited States NavyOffice of Naval Research)","This manuscript is a product of the North Pacific Research Board Arctic Integrated Ecosystem Research Program, NPRB publication number ArcticIERP-35.

Thus, bacterial community dynamics across the wider Indian Ocean are largely undescribed. As part of Bio-GO-SHIP, we sequenced the 16S rRNA gene from 465 samples collected on sections I07N and I09N. We found that (1) there were 23 distinct bioregions within the Indian Ocean, (2) the southeastern gyre had the largest gradient in bacterial alpha-diversity, (3) the Indian Ocean surface microbiome was primarily composed of a core set of taxa, and (4) bioregions were characterized by transitions in physical and geochemical conditions. Overall, we showed that bacterial community structure spatially delineated the surface Indian Ocean and that these microbially defined regions were reflective of subtle ocean physical and geochemical gradients. Therefore, incorporating metrics of in situ microbial communities into marine ecological regions traditionally defined by remote sensing will improve our ability to delineate warm, oligotrophic regions.","[Brock, Melissa L.; Martiny, Adam C.] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Larkin, Alyse A.; Martiny, Adam C.] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Raes, Eric J.] Minderoo Fdn, Broadway, Nedlands, WA, Australia","University of California System; University of California Irvine; University of California System; University of California Irvine; Minderoo Foundation","Martiny, AC (corresponding author), Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.;Martiny, AC (corresponding author), Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.","amartiny@uci.edu","Martiny, Adam/AAC-4459-2019","Brock, Melissa/0000-0003-4032-9241","National Aeronautics and Space Administration; National Science Foundation [1559002, 1848576, 1948842]; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration [101813-Z7554214]; National Institutes of Health [T32AI141346]; [80NSSC21K1654]","National Aeronautics and Space Administration(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA);","We thank many lab members for their help with collecting and analyzing the samples and the GO-SHIP community for enabling cruise participation and sampling.

We find latitudinal variability in C:N:P stoichiometry, with surface temperature and macronutrient availability as strong predictors of stoichiometry at high latitudes. Genomic observations indicated community nutrient stress and suggested that nutrient supply rate and nitrogen-versus-phosphorus stress are predictive of hemispheric and regional variations in stoichiometry. Our data-derived statistical model suggests that C:P and N:P ratios will increase at high latitudes in the future, however, changes at low latitudes are uncertain. Our findings suggest systematic regulation of elemental stoichiometry among ocean ecosystems, but that future changes remain highly uncertain.

The sequenced viral genome (similar to 190,000 bp) comprised 185 predicted ORFs, including those encoding 26 iridoviral core proteins, and phylogenetic analyses showed that CaSpA-IV is a close relative to members of the genus Decapodiridovirus and highly identical to a partially sequenced virus pathogenic to decapod shrimps. CaSpA-W was found in various anatomical regions of six C. grandis (sphere, stem, root) from the Gulf of Maine and Baffin Bay and of two C. oxeata (sphere, secondary axis) from Baffin Bay. Partial MCP sequencing revealed a divergent virus (CaSpA-IV-2) in one C. oxeata. The analysis of a 10 nt long tandem repeat showed a number of repeats consistent across sub-sections of the same sponges but different between animals, suggesting the presence of different strains. As the genetic material of crustaceans, particularly from the zooplanktonic copepod order Calanoida, was identified in the investigated samples, further studies are required to elucidate whether CaSpA-IV infects the carnivorous sponges, their crustacean prey, or both.","[Canuti, Marta; Large, Gabrielle; Verhoeven, Joost T.

We synthesized observational studies of extreme events in these aquatic ecosystems, finding that many studies do not use consistent definitions of extreme events. Furthermore, many studies do not capture ecological responses across the full spatial scale of the events. In contrast, sampling often extends across longer temporal scales than the event itself, highlighting the usefulness of long-term monitoring. Many ecological studies of extreme events measure biological responses but exclude chemical and physical responses, underscoring the need for integrative and multidisciplinary approaches. To advance extreme event research, we suggest prioritizing pre- and postevent data collection, including leveraging long-term monitoring; making intersite and cross-scale comparisons; adopting novel empirical and statistical approaches; and developing funding streams to support flexible and responsive data collection.","[Aoki, Lillian R.] Cornell Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA; [Aoki, Lillian R.] Univ Oregon, Data Sci Initiat, Eugene, OR 97403 USA; [Brisbin, Margaret Mars] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Biol Dept, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; [Brisbin, Margaret Mars] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Marine Chem & Geochem Dept, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; [Hounshell, Alexandria G.] Virginia Tech, Biol Sci Dept, Blacksburg, VA USA; [Hounshell, Alexandria G.] NOAA, Natl Ctr Coastal Ocean Sci, Silver Spring, MD USA; [Kincaid, Dustin W.] Univ Vermont, Vermont EPSCoR, Burlington, VT USA; [Kincaid, Dustin W.] Univ Vermont, Gund Inst Environm, Burlington, VT USA; [Larson, Erin, I] Alaska Pacific Univ, Inst Culture & Environm, Anchorage, AK USA; [Sansom, Brandon J.] State Univ New York Univ Buffalo, Dept Geog, Buffalo, NY USA; [Sansom, Brandon J.] US Geol Survey, Columbia Environm Res Ctr, Columbia, MO USA; [Shogren, Arial J.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Shogren, Arial J.] Univ Alabama, Dept Biol Sci, Tuscaloosa, AL USA; [Smith, Rachel S.] Univ Virginia, Dept Environm Sci, Clark Hall, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA; [Sullivan-Stack, Jenna] Oregon State Univ, Dept Integrat Biol, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA","Cornell University; University of Oregon; Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution; Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution; Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; National Ocean Service, NOAA; National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science (NOOCS); University of Vermont; University of Vermont; Alaska Pacific University; State University of New York (SUNY) System; University at Buffalo, SUNY; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; Michigan State University; University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Tuscaloosa; University of Virginia; Oregon State University","Aoki, LR (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA.;Aoki, LR (corresponding author), Univ Oregon, Data Sci Initiat, Eugene, OR 97403 USA.","lra53@cornell.edu","Kincaid, Dustin/AFQ-5401-2022; Brisbin, Margaret/AAX-3071-2020","Larson, Erin/0000-0002-7797-0529; Aoki, Lillian/0000-0002-2792-0523; Smith, Rachel/0000-0002-8713-126X; Kincaid, Dustin/0000-0003-1640-685X","NSF Biological Oceanography Program [OCE-1356192, OCE-1925796]; NSF [OCE-1829921, DEB-1753639, EAR-1659909, DBI-1906381]; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science DC1 graduate student fellowship; Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University; NSF under VT EPSCoR [OIA-1556770]; Nature Conservancy; University of Virginia; Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography","NSF Biological Oceanography Program(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO)); NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Japan Society for the Promotion of Science DC1 graduate student fellowship(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University(Okinawa Institute of Science & Technology Graduate University); NSF under VT EPSCoR; Nature Conservancy; University of Virginia; Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography","We initiated this collaborative study at the Eco-DAS XIII symposium, and we thank and acknowledge Paul Kemp for his leadership, other Eco-DAS participants for their engagement and feedback, and the Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography for financial support for EcoDAS.

It is unclear, however, if these differences are due to environmental differences, including turbidity, or genomic differences between the coral hosts in these different environments. One particularly interesting case is in the coral genus Porites, which contains numerous morphologically similar massive Porites species inhabiting a wide range of reef habitats, from turbid river deltas and stagnant back reefs to high-energy fore reefs. Here, we generate ddRAD data for 172 Porites corals from river delta and adjacent (<0.5 km) fore reef populations on Guam to assess the extent of genetic differentiation among massive Porites corals in these two contrasting environments and throughout the island. Phylogenetic and population genomic analyses consistently identify seven different clades of massive Porites, with the two largest clades predominantly inhabiting either river deltas or fore reefs, respectively. No population structure was detected in the two largest clades, and Cladocopium was the dominant symbiont genus in all clades and environments. The perceived bleaching resilience of corals in marginal reefs may therefore be attributed to interspecific differences between morphologically similar species, in addition to potentially mediating environmental differences. Marginal reef environments may therefore not provide a suitable refuge for many reef corals in a heating world, but instead host additional cryptic coral diversity.","[Primov, Karim D.; Burdick, David R.; Lemer, Sarah; Combosch, David J.] Univ Guam, Marine Lab, UOG Stn, Mangilao, GU 96923 USA; [Primov, Karim D.] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Integrat Biol, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Forsman, Zac H.] King Abdullah Univ Sci & Technol, Thuwal 23955, Saudi Arabia","University of Guam; University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; King Abdullah University of Science & Technology","Primov, KD (corresponding author), Univ Guam, Marine Lab, UOG Stn, Mangilao, GU 96923 USA.;Primov, KD (corresponding author), Univ Texas Austin, Dept Integrat Biol, Austin, TX 78712 USA.","kprimov1@gmail.com","","Combosch, David/0000-0001-7004-7435","NSF [OIA-1457769, OIA-1946352]; Guam NSF EPSCoR through the National Science Foundation [P16AC01681]; NOAA's Coral Reef Conservation Grant [P21AC12027]; National Park Service","NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Guam NSF EPSCoR through the National Science Foundation; NOAA's Coral Reef Conservation Grant; National Park Service","We would like to deeply thank Dareon Rios for laboratory, bioinformatic, and analytical assistance.

At 28 locations within the Susquehanna River basin, 10-liter samples were assessed in spring and summer over 2 years. Salmonella prevalence was 49%, and increased river discharge was the main driver of Salmonella presence. The amplicon-based sequencing tool, CRISPR-SeroSeq, was used to determine serovar population diversity and detected 25 different Salmonella serovars, including up to 10 serovars from a single water sample. On average, there were three serovars per sample, and 80% of Salmonella-positive samples contained more than one serovar. Serovars Give, Typhimurium, Thompson, and Infantis were identified throughout the watershed and over multiple collections. Seasonal differences were evident: serovar Give was abundant in the spring, whereas serovar Infantis was more frequently identified in the summer. Eight of the ten serovars most commonly associated with human illness were detected in this study. Crucially, six of these serovars often existed in the background, where they were masked by a more abundant serovar(s) in a sample. Serovars Enteritidis and Typhimurium, especially, were masked in 71 and 78% of samples where they were detected, respectively. Whole-genome sequencing-based phylogeny demonstrated that strains within the same serovar collected throughout the watershed were also very diverse. The Susquehanna River basin is the largest system where Salmonella prevalence and serovar diversity have been temporally and spatially investigated, and this study reveals an extraordinary level of inter- and intraserovar diversity. IMPORTANCE Salmonella is a leading cause of bacterial foodborne illness in the United States, and outbreaks linked to fresh produce are increasing. Understanding Salmonella ecology in freshwater is of importance, especially where irrigation practices or recreational use occur. As the third largest river in the United States east of the Mississippi, the Susquehanna River is the largest freshwater contributor to the Chesapeake Bay, and it is the largest river system where Salmonella diversity has been studied. Rainfall and subsequent high river discharge rates were the greatest indicators of Salmonella presence in the Susquehanna and its tributaries. Several Salmonella serovars were identified, including eight commonly associated with foodbome illness. Many clinically important serovars were present at a low frequency within individual samples and so could not be detected by conventional culture methods. The technologies employed here reveal an average of three serovars in a 10-liter sample of water and up to 10 serovars in a single sample.","[Deaven, Abigail M.; Rios, Paula C.; Shariat, Nikki W.] Univ Georgia, Dept Populat Hlth, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Deaven, Abigail M.] Gettysburg Coll, Dept Biol, Gettysburg, PA USA; [Ferreira, Christina M.; Reed, Elizabeth A.; Marogi, Jacob G.; Zheng, Jie; Bell, Rebecca L.] US FDA, Div Microbiol, Ctr Food Safety & Appl Nutr, College Pk, MD USA; [See, Jeremy R.

Prl release in the rostral pars distalis (RPD) of the pituitary is directly stimulated by a fall in extracellular osmolality. Recently, we identified several putative transcription factor modules (TFM) predicted to bind to the promoter regions of the two prl isoforms in Mozambique tilapia, Oreochromis mossambicus. We characterized the effects of extracellular osmolality on the activation of these TFMs from RPDs, in vivo and in vitro. OCT1_PIT1 01, CEBP_CEBP 01 and BRNF_RXRF 01 were significantly activated in freshwater (FW)-acclimated tilapia RPDs while SORY_PAX3 02 and SP1F_SP1F 06, SP1F_SP1F 09 were significantly activated in seawater (SW)-counterparts. Short-term incubation of SW- accli-mated tilapia RPDs in hyposmotic media (280 mOsm/kg) resulted in activation of CAAT_AP1F 01, OCT1_CEBP 01, AP1F_SMAD 01, GATA_SP1F 01, SORY_PAX6 01 and CREB_EBOX 02, EBOX_AP2F 01, EBOX_MITF 01 while hyperosmotic media (420 mOsm/kg) activated SORY_PAX3 02 and AP1F_SMAD 01 in FW-tilapia. Short-term incubation of dispersed Prl cells from FW-acclimated fish exposed to hyperosmotic conditions decreased pou1f1, pou2f1b, stat3, stat1a and ap1b1 expression, while pou1f1, pou2f1b, and stat3 were inversely related to osmolality in their SW-counterparts. Further, in Prl cells of SW-tilapia, creb3l1 was suppressed in hyposmotic media. Collectively, our results indicate that multiple TFMs are involved in regulating prl transcription at different acclimation salinities and, together, they modulate responses of Prl cells to changes in extracellular osmolality. These responses reflect the complexity of osmosensitive molecular regulation of the osmoreceptive Prl cell of a euryhaline teleost.","[Malintha, G. H.

However, genetic rescue attempts have largely been limited to populations at the brink of extinction, in part due to concerns over negative outcomes (e.g., outbreeding depression). Increasing habitat fragmentation may necessitate more proactive genetic management. Broader application of augmented gene flow will, in turn, require rigorous evaluation to increase confidence and identify pitfalls in this approach. To date, there has been no assessment of best monitoring practices for genetic rescue attempts. We used genomically explicit, individual-based simulations to examine the effectiveness of common approaches (i.e., tests for increases in fitness, migrant ancestry, heterozygosity, and abundance) for determining whether genetic rescue or outbreeding depression occurred. Statistical power to detect the effects of gene flow on fitness was high (>0.8) when effect sizes were large, a finding consistent with those from previous studies on severely inbred populations. However, smaller effects of gene flow on fitness can appreciably affect persistence probability but current evaluation approaches fail to provide results from which reliable inferences can be drawn. The power of the metrics we examined to evaluate genetic rescue attempts depended on the time since gene flow and whether gene flow was beneficial or deleterious. Encouragingly, the use of multiple metrics provided nonredundant information and improved inference reliability, highlighting the importance of intensive monitoring efforts. Further development of best practices for evaluating genetic rescue attempts will be crucial for a responsible transition to increased use of translocations to decrease extinction risk.","[Robinson, Zachary L.; Bell, Donovan A.; Luikart, Gordon; Whiteley, Andrew R.; Kardos, Marty] Univ Montana, WA Franke Coll Forestry & Conservat, Wildlife Biol Program, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Dhendup, Tashi] Ugyen Wangchuck Inst Conservat & Environm Res, Dept Forest & Pk Serv, Bumthang 32001, Bhutan; [Luikart, Gordon; Kardos, Marty] Univ Montana, Coll Humanities & Sci, Flathead Lake Biol Stn, Div Biol Sci, Missoula, MT 59860 USA; [Kardos, Marty] NOAA, Northwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, 2725 Montlake Blvd E, Seattle, WA 98112 USA","University of Montana System; University of Montana; University of Montana System; University of Montana; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA","Robinson, ZL (corresponding author), Univ Montana, WA Franke Coll Forestry & Conservat, Wildlife Biol Program, Missoula, MT 59812 USA.","zachary.robinson@umontana.edu","luikart, gordon/L-8888-2013","Whiteley, Andrew/0000-0002-8159-6381; Kardos, Marty/0000-0002-7587-3004","National Science Foundation (NSF) CAREER grant [DEB-1652278]; USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture, McIntire Stennis project [1021598]; W.A.

Here, the spatial ecology of Atlantic halibut (Hippoglossus hippoglossus L.), managed as four stocks in the Northwest Atlantic, is reviewed. Halibut collapsed under high exploitation in the mid-19th century, but the Canadian fisheries value has increased seven-fold since the early 2000s. Atlantic halibut's thermal habitat has increased due to warming, possibly contributing to its expansion. Genomic evidence differentiates two populations in the four management units, whereas there is non-genetic spatial structure within each of the stock boundaries. There are different core juvenile areas and a diversity of spawning migration patterns influenced by timing, fish size, maturity state, and distance between summer-feeding and over-wintering habitats. From tagging studies, multiple estimates of median distance at recapture (similar to 3-90 km) are much less than the spatial domain of each stock. Growth rates are faster in the warmer south, as predicted by growing degree day. The current perspective of Atlantic halibut spatial structure is that there are two distinct populations, and within each, there are subpopulations composed of multiple migratory contingents. The level of mixing on common spawning grounds both among and within subpopulations is only partly understood.","[Shackell, Nancy L.; den Heyer, Cornelia E.; Kess, Tony; Czich, Andrew; Frank, Kenneth T.] Bedford Inst Oceanog, Fisheries & Oceans Canada, Dartmouth, NS, Canada; [Fisher, Jonathan A.

Cubozoan toxicity has been attributed to the presence and abundance of cnidarian-specific pore-forming toxins called jellyfish toxins (JFTs), which are highly hemolytic and cardiotoxic. However, JFTs have also been found in other cnidarians outside of Cubozoa, and no comprehensive analysis of their phylogenetic distribution has been conducted to date. Here, we present a thorough annotation of JFTs from 147 cnidarian transcriptomes and document 111 novel putative JFTs from over 20 species within Medusozoa. Phylogenetic analyses show that JFTs form two distinct clades, which we call JFT-1 and JFT-2. JFT-1 includes all known potent cubozoan toxins, as well as hydrozoan and scyphozoan representatives, some of which were derived from medically relevant species. JFT-2 contains primarily uncharacterized JFTs. Although our analyses detected broad purifying selection across JFTs, we found that a subset of cubozoan JFT-1 sequences are influenced by gene-wide episodic positive selection compared with homologous toxins from other taxonomic groups. This suggests that duplication followed by neofunctionalization or subfunctionalization as a potential mechanism for the highly potent venom in cubozoans. Additionally, published RNA-seq data from several medusozoan species indicate that JFTs are differentially expressed, spatially and temporally, between functionally distinct tissues. Overall, our findings suggest a complex evolutionary history of JFTs involving duplication and selection that may have led to functional diversification, including variability in toxin potency and specificity.","[Klompen, Anna M.

By using DNA barcoding, a global bioidentification system for animals, along with morphological investigation, we can confirm species identifications. We have a better chance of eliminating misidentifications and, therefore, documenting the correct abundance and distribution of cephalopods within an area by combining morphological and molecular evidence. The central objectives of this study are to: (1) compare morphological vs molecular identification of cephalopods and (2) determine the occurrence of cephalopods within the deep scattering layer (DSL) within warm core eddies. The specimens reported here were collected between 2014 and 2016 during three transatlantic cruises from Galway, Ireland to St John's, Newfoundland, with a focus on assemblages in warm-core mesoscale eddies on the western part of the transect. Samples were collected from the DSL at multiple stations across mesoscale eddies. In total, 301 cephalopods belonging to 29 species were collected. Not only does our study increase the knowledge of abundance and diversity of pelagic cephalopods in this area, but it also provides sequences for species for which no comparative sequences were previously available. By examining the match/mismatch between morphological and molecular identifications, we highlight a need for revisions in some taxonomic groupings such as the family Cranchiidae.","[Taite, Morag; Fennell, Sheena; Allcock, A.

Ancestral state reconstructions suggest that postnatal teeth were lost in the common ancestor of crown Mysticeti. Genomic studies provide some support for this hypothesis and suggest that the genetic toolkit for enamel production was inactivated in the common ancestor of living baleen whales. However, molecular studies to date have not provided direct evidence for the complete loss of teeth, including their dentin component, on the stem mysticete branch. Given these results, several questions remain unanswered: (1) Were teeth lost in a single step or did enamel loss precede dentin loss? (2) Was enamel lost early or late on the stem mysticete branch? (3) If enamel and dentin/tooth loss were decoupled in the ancestry of baleen whales, did dentin loss occur on the stem mysticete branch or independently in different crown mysticete lineages? To address these outstanding questions, we compiled and analyzed complete protein-coding sequences for nine tooth-related genes from cetaceans with available genome data. Seven of these genes are associated with enamel formation (ACP4, AMBN, AMELX, AMTN, ENAM, KLK4, MMP20) whereas two other genes are either dentinspecific (DSPP) or tooth-specific (ODAPH) but not enamel-specific. Molecular evolutionary analyses indicate that all seven enamel-specific genes have inactivating mutations that are scattered across branches of the mysticete tree. Three of the enamel genes (ACP4, KLK4, MMP20) have inactivating mutations that are shared by all mysticetes. The two genes that are dentin-specific (DSPP) or tooth-specific (ODAPH) do not have any inactivating mutations that are shared by all mysticetes, but there are shared mutations in Balaenidae as well as in Plicogulae (Neobalaenidae + Balaenopteroidea). These shared mutations suggest that teeth were lost at most two times. Shared inactivating mutations and dN/dS analyses, in combination with cetacean divergence times, were used to estimate inactivation times of genes and by proxy enamel and tooth phenotypes at ancestral nodes. The results of these analyses are most compatible with a two-step model for the loss of teeth in the ancestry of living baleen whales: enamel was lost very early on the stem Mysticeti branch followed by the independent loss of dentin (and teeth) in the common ancestors of Balaenidae and Plicogulae, respectively. These results imply that some stem mysticetes, and even early crown mysticetes, may have had vestigial teeth comprised of dentin with no enamel. Our results also demonstrate that all odontocete species (in our study) with absent or degenerative enamel have inactivating mutations in one or more of their enamel genes.","[Randall, Jason G.; Springer, Mark S.] Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Evolut Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; [Gatesy, John] Amer Museum Nat Hist, Div Vertebrate Zool, New York, NY 10024 USA","University of California System; University of California Riverside; American Museum of Natural History (AMNH)","Randall, JG; Springer, MS (corresponding author), Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Evolut Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Riverside, CA 92521 USA.","jrand006@ucr.edu; jgatesy@amnh.org; springer@ucr.edu","","","National Science Foundation [DEB-1457735]; Southwest Fisheries Science Center (SWFSC) [5989]; Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center [175303]","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Southwest Fisheries Science Center (SWFSC)(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center","This work was supported by National Science Foundation grant DEB-1457735 (J.G., M.S.S.) .

This is the case with the iconic group of elasmobranchs known as the sawfish of the genus Pristis, all four species of which are considered as Endangered or Critically Endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN, Switzerland). Examination of cestodes from three species of sawfish (Pristis pristis, Pristis clavata, and Pristis zijsron) in Australia and one of their close relatives, the also critically endangered widenose gui-tarfish, Glaucostegus obtusus, in India, collected over the past 25 years, yielded four new species of tape-worms which are described herein. All four belong to the previously monotypic Mixobothrium; the diagnosis of the genus is revised to accommodate the new species. Among the new taxa is a species that had been included in previous molecular phylogenies but whose identity and affinities within the order Rhinebothriidea, and thus also its familial placement, were unclear. This species exhibits the morpholog-ical features of Mixobothrium and thus its identity is, at long last, revealed. Sequence data generated for the 28S rDNA gene for three of the new species, as well as an additional new but yet undescribed species from Pristis pectinata from Florida (USA), confirms the uniqueness of this group among the rhinebothri-ideans. The new family Mixobothriidae is established to house these taxa. The members of this family differ from all but one of the five other families of rhinebothriideans in lacking apical suckers on their bothridia. They are also distinctive in that their bothridia are divided into three regions. The anterior and posterior regions have similar locular configurations to one another and differ from the locular con-figuration of the middle region. As a consequence, the bothridia are symmetrical along both their vertical and horizontal axes. We predict that a focus on species of guitarfish in the genus Glaucostegus will be the most productive approach for discovering additional diversity in this family of cestodes.(c) 2023 Australian Society for Parasitology.

This variation can be attributed to a variety of factors including the strength of evolutionary processes like selection, gene flow, time since divergence, and/or genetic drift, as well as the interactions between these processes. A number of simulation and theoretical studies have helped elucidate the role of these processes on the genomic basis of adaptation (Schaal et al., 2022; Yeaman et al., 2016). However, complementary empirical studies to test these theoretical expectations for within-species adaptation have been limited due to the challenging nature of evaluating these processes in a comparative framework. To do this effectively, it is necessary to have systems where the range of environmental variation is similar between species, but where one or more of these evolutionary processes vary. In a From the Cover article in this issue of Molecular Ecology, Shi et al. (2022) provide an excellent example of a freshwater system where rates of gene flow differ between populations of six riverine species due to variation in spawning strategies (i.e., broadcast spawners = high gene flow, nest spawners = low gene flow), but all experience the same variation in environmental conditions across their distributions. The authors take a multivariate approach to evaluate the genomic basis of adaptation by using a combination of differentiation-based and genotype-environment association (GEA) methods. By comparing the amount of gene flow between species and the resulting genomic basis of local adaptation, they are able to infer how genomic architecture may be shaped by rates of gene flow. Their results identify a general pattern of increased genomic clustering in species with increasing levels of gene flow. However, two of six species did not follow this pattern, which could be due to additional factors not assessed. Additionally, they provide convincing evidence that the underlying evolutionary mechanisms that formed genomic clusters within each species vary. These deviations from a general pattern highlight how difficult evaluating these processes in natural populations are, particularly because species-specific responses can vary dramatically. Taken together, their comparative framework for assessing the genomic architecture of adaptation is unique, sheds important light on how evolutionary processes can impact adaptation, and provides robust empirical support of foundational theoretical and simulation studies.","[Schaal, Sara M.] NOAA, Alaska Fisheries Sci Ctr, Seattle, WA 98115 USA; [Smith, Sara J.] Mt Royal Univ, Dept Biol, Calgary, AB, Canada","National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Mount Royal University","Schaal, SM (corresponding author), NOAA, Alaska Fisheries Sci Ctr, Seattle, WA 98115 USA.","sara.schaal@noaa.gov","Smith Wuitchik, Sara/AFP-4130-2022","Schaal, Sara/0000-0001-5986-0193; Smith, Sara Jayne/0000-0002-1913-0396","","","",NA,10,0,0,0,9,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","0962-1083","1365-294X","","MOL ECOL","Mol.

The previous hierarchical classification method demonstrates efficient fish species identification of catches from longline fishing, where fishes are under severe deformation and self-occlusion during the catching process. Although the hierarchical classification mitigates the laborious efforts of human reviews by providing confidence scores in different hierarchical levels, its performance drops dramatically under the class incremental learning (CIL) scenario. A CIL system should be able to learn about more and more classes over time from a stream of data, i.e., only the training data for a small number of classes have to be present at the beginning and new classes can be added progressively. In this work, we introduce a Hierarchical Class Incremental Learning (HCIL) model, which significantly improves the state-of-the-art hierarchical classification methods under the CIL scenario.","[Mei, Jie; Hwang, Jenq-Neng] Univ Washington, Dept ECE, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Romain, Suzanne; Rose, Craig; Magrane, Kelsey] NOAA, Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commiss, Washington, DC USA","University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA","Mei, J (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Dept ECE, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.","jiemei@uw.edu; suzanne.romain@noaa.gov; craig.rose@noaa.gov; kelsey.magrane@noaa.gov; hwang@uw.edu","mei, jie/KMA-6084-2024","","","","",NA,20,1,1,1,3,"IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","1522-4880","","978-1-6654-9620-9","IEEE IMAGE PROC","","",2022,NA,"",NA,"","","",3662,3666,"","10.1109/ICIP46576.2022.9897938","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICIP46576.2022.9897938",NA,"",5,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Engineering","BV6JK",NA,"Green Submitted","","","2024-10-25","WOS:001058109503148","View Full Record in Web of Science",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We accepted this challenge for the jellyfish genus Aurelia, which has a long and confusing taxonomic history. We demonstrate that morphological variability in Aurelia medusae overlaps across very distant geographic localities. Even though some morphological features seem responsible for most of the variation, regional geographic patterns of dissimilarities are lacking. This is further emphasized by morphological differences found when comparing lab-cultured Aurelia coerulea medusae with the diagnostic features in its recent redescription. Previous studies have also highlighted the difficulties in distinguishing Aurelia polyps and ephyrae, and their morphological plasticity. Therefore, mostly based on genetic data, we recognize 28 species of Aurelia, of which seven were already described, 10 are formally described herein, four are resurrected and seven remain undescribed. We present diagnostic genetic characters for all species and designate type materials for newly described and some resurrected species. Recognizing moon jellyfish diversity with formal names is vital for conservation efforts and other studies. This work clarifies the practical implications of molecular genetic data as diagnostic characters, and sheds light on the patterns and processes that generate crypsis.","[Lawley, Jonathan W.; Gamero-Mora, Edgar; Maronna, Maximiliano M.; Morandini, Andre C.] Univ Sao Paulo, Inst Biociencias, Dept Zool, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil; [Lawley, Jonathan W.] Griffith Univ, Coastal & Marine Res Ctr, Sch Environm & Sci, Australian Rivers Inst, Gold Coast, Qld, Australia; [Chiaverano, Luciano M.] Inst Nacl Invest & Desarrollo Pesquero, Mar Del Plata, Buenos Aires, Argentina; [Stampar, Sergio N.] Univ Estadual Paulista, Fac Ciencias & Letras, Dept Ciencias Biol, Assis, SP, Brazil; [Hopcroft, Russell R.] Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Coll Fisheries & Ocean Sci, Fairbanks, AK USA; [Collins, Allen G.] NOAA, Natl Systemat Lab, Fisheries Serv, Natl Museum Nat Hist,Smithsonian Inst, Washington, DC USA; [Morandini, Andre C.] Univ Sao Paulo, Ctr Biol Marinha, Sao Sebastiao, SP, Brazil","Universidade de Sao Paulo; Griffith University; Griffith University - Gold Coast Campus; National Fisheries Research & Development Institute (INIDEP); Universidade Estadual Paulista; University of Alaska System; University of Alaska Fairbanks; Smithsonian Institution; Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Universidade de Sao Paulo","Lawley, JW (corresponding author), Univ Sao Paulo, Inst Biociencias, Dept Zool, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.;Lawley, JW (corresponding author), Griffith Univ, Coastal & Marine Res Ctr, Sch Environm & Sci, Australian Rivers Inst, Gold Coast, Qld, Australia.","jonathan.wanderleylawley@griffithuni.edu.au","Gamero-Mora, Edgar/AAN-7625-2021; Stampar, Sergio/AAC-6966-2022; Maronna, Maximiliano/G-9432-2016; Morandini, Andre Carrara/A-9892-2012; Collins, Allen/A-7944-2008; W.

Among marine animals with nonmigratory adults, the presence or absence of a pelagic larval stage is thought to be a key determinant in shaping gene flow and the genetic structure of populations. In addition, the spatial distribution of suitable habitats is expected to influence the distribution of biological populations and their connectivity patterns. We used whole genome sequencing to study demographic history and reduced representation (double-digest restriction associated DNA) sequencing data to analyse spatial genetic structure in broadnosed pipefish (Syngnathus typhle). Its main habitat is eelgrass beds, which are patchily distributed along the study area in southern Norway. Demographic connectivity among populations was inferred from long-term (similar to 30-year) population counts that uncovered a rapid decline in spatial correlations in abundance with distance as short as similar to 2 km. These findings were contrasted with data for two other fish species that have a pelagic larval stage (corkwing wrasse, Symphodus melops; black goby, Gobius niger). For these latter species, we found wider spatial scales of connectivity and weaker genetic isolation-by-distance patterns, except where both species experienced a strong barrier to gene flow, seemingly due to lack of suitable habitat. Our findings verify expectations that a fragmented habitat and absence of a pelagic larval stage promote genetic structure, while presence of a pelagic larvae stage increases demographic connectivity and gene flow, except perhaps over extensive habitat gaps.","[Knutsen, Halvor; Hutchings, Jeffrey A.; Mellerud, Ida; Espeland, Sigurd H.; Jorde, Per Erik] Inst Marine Res, His, Norway; [Knutsen, Halvor; Catarino, Diana; Sodeland, Marte; Mattingsdal, Morten; Hutchings, Jeffrey A.; Espeland, Sigurd H.] Univ Agder, Ctr Coastal Res, Dept Nat Sci, Kristiansand, Norway; [Rogers, Lauren] NOAA, Alaska Fisheries Sci Ctr, Seattle, WA USA; [Jahnke, Marlene; Johanneson, Kerstin; Andre, Carl] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Marine Sci Tjarno, Stromstad, Sweden; [Hutchings, Jeffrey A.] Dalhousie Univ, Dept Biol, Halifax, NS, Canada; [Roth, Olivia] Univ Kiel, Zool Inst, Marine Evolutionary Biol, Kiel, Germany; [Hansen, Michael M.] Aarhus Univ, Dept Biol, Aarhus C, Denmark; [Jentoft, Sissel] Univ Oslo, Ctr Ecol & Evolutionary Synth CEES, Dept Biosci, Oslo, Norway","Institute of Marine Research - Norway; University of Agder; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of Gothenburg; Dalhousie University; University of Kiel; Aarhus University; University of Oslo","Knutsen, H (corresponding author), Inst Marine Res, His, Norway.","halvor.knutsen@hi.no","Catarino, Diana/AAJ-3193-2021; Hutchings, Jeffrey/ABA-1098-2020; Johannesson, Kerstin/B-5528-2013; Andre, Carl/B-4237-2010; Roth, Olivia/M-3379-2016; Jahnke, marlene/KPA-8822-2024; Hansen, Michael/Z-5047-2019; mattingsdal, morten/H-6133-2019; Knutsen, Halvor/A-4261-2009; Mattingsdal, Morten/Q-9367-2016; Hansen, Michael M./I-5979-2013","Knutsen, Halvor/0000-0002-7627-7634; Jahnke, Marlene/0000-0001-7262-315X; Sodeland, Marte/0000-0001-6703-3972; Johannesson, Kerstin/0000-0003-0176-7986; Mattingsdal, Morten/0000-0003-4440-0324; Hansen, Michael M./0000-0001-5372-4828; Rogers, Lauren/0000-0003-3305-6441; Catarino, Diana/0000-0003-0635-6174","Norwegian Research Council (NRC) through the project ECOGENOME [280453]; MarGen II, an Intereg project under the Oresund-Kattegat-Skagerrak programme; Ministry of Trade, Industry and Fisheries","Norwegian Research Council (NRC) through the project ECOGENOME(Research Council of Norway); MarGen II, an Intereg project under the Oresund-Kattegat-Skagerrak programme; Ministry of Trade, Industry and Fisheries","This work was funded by the Norwegian Research Council (NRC) through the project ECOGENOME (project no.: 280453), by MarGen II, an Intereg project under the Oresund--Kattegat--Skagerrak programme, and by the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Fisheries",NA,92,11,12,8,35,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","0962-1083","1365-294X","","MOL ECOL","Mol.

OA can cause alterations in various physiological processes such as growth and metabolism, although its effect on host-pathogen interactions remains largely unexplored. In this study, we used transcriptomics, proteomics, and physiological assays to evaluate changes in immunity of the eastern oyster Crassostrea virginica exposed to OA conditions (pH = 7.5 vs pH = 7.9) at various life stages. The susceptibility of oyster larvae to Vibrio infection increased significantly (131 % increase in mortality) under OA conditions, and was associated with significant changes in their transcriptomes. The significantly higher mortality of larvae exposed to pathogens and acidification stress could be the outcome of an increased metabolic demand to cope with acidification stress (as seen by upregulation of metabolic genes) at the cost of immune function (downregulation of immune genes). While larvae were particularly vulnerable, juveniles appeared more robust to the stressors and there were no differences in mortality after pathogen (Aliiroseovarius crassostrea and Vibrio spp.) exposure. Proteomic investigations in adult oysters revealed that acidification stress resulted in a significant downregulation of mucosal immune proteins including those involved in pathogen recognition and microbe neutralization, suggesting weakened mucosal immunity. Hemocyte function in adults was also impaired by high pCO2, with a marked reduction in phagocytosis (67 % decrease in phagocytosis) in OA conditions. Together, results suggest that OA impairs immune function in the eastern oyster making them more susceptible to pathogen-induced mortality outbreaks. Understanding the effect of multiple stressors such as OA and disease is important for accurate predictions of how oysters will respond to future climate regimes.","[Schwaner, Caroline; Barbosa, Michelle; Espinosa, Emmanuelle Pales; Allam, Bassem] SUNY Stony Brook, Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Stony Brook, NY 11790 USA; [Haley, John] SUNY Stony Brook, Biol Mass Spectrometry Ctr, Stony Brook Med, Stony Brook 11790, NY USA","State University of New York (SUNY) System; Stony Brook University; State University of New York (SUNY) System; Stony Brook University; Stony Brook University Hospital","Allam, B (corresponding author), SUNY Stony Brook, Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Stony Brook, NY 11790 USA.","bassem.allam@stonybrook.edu","","Allam, Bassem/0000-0003-1278-7915; Pales Espinosa, Emmanuelle/0000-0003-1779-6757","New York Sea Grant program [R/XG-24, R/XG-33]; National Science Foundation [IOS 1656753]; Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission; Ocean Coastal and Estuarine Acidification Graduate Research Fellowship by the Mid-Atlantic Sea Grant NOAA Ocean Acidification Program; [19-0802]","New York Sea Grant program; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission; Ocean Coastal and Estuarine Acidification Graduate Research Fellowship by the Mid-Atlantic Sea Grant NOAA Ocean Acidification Program;","This research was supported by the New York Sea Grant program (projects R/XG-24 and R/XG-33) .

Efficiently characterizing it, rapidly at high resolution, is the frontier for understanding global change and management. The biggest impediment to breaching that frontier is inadequate DNA reference libraries, which can currently identify <25% of animal species in environmental profiles. Over the course of the decade, we will build from our existing global network of museums, universities, federal agencies, and the private sector in a broad collaboration to produce the Ocean Biocode, a well-sampled, voucher-based, open-access reference library of U.S. marine species that will eliminate dark taxa (no name or phylogenetic position) from U.S. waters and support a new era in high-resolution oceanography and environmental science founded on accurate environmental DNA sampling. We need not sequence every species; a strategic, empirically guided inventory will fill key gaps by focusing BioBlitz efforts at one focal site in each marine ecoregion of the U.S. EEZ, targeting taxa missing from regional libraries, coupled with genome skimming, to create reference libraries of whole mtDNA and nuclear ribosomal cluster. This Ocean Biocode moves beyond the barcode to allow design of targeted probes for non-amplicon species detection, yielding species-level information to stakeholders and enabling future technologies.","[Meyer, Christopher] Smithsonian Inst, Natl Museum Nat Hist, Washington, DC 20560 USA; [Duffy, Emmett] Smithsonian Inst, Tennenbaum Marine Observ Network, Washington, DC 20560 USA; [Collins, Allen] NOAA, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Natl Systemat Lab, Natl Museum Nat Hist,Smithsonian Inst, Washington, DC USA; [Paulay, Gustav] Florida Museum Nat Hist, Gainesville, FL USA; [Wetzer, Regina] Nat Hist Museum Los Angeles Cty, Los Angeles, CA USA","Smithsonian Institution; Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History; Smithsonian Institution; Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Smithsonian Institution; Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History","Meyer, C (corresponding author), Smithsonian Inst, Natl Museum Nat Hist, Washington, DC 20560 USA.","MeyerC@si.edu","; Collins, Allen/A-7944-2008","Meyer, Christopher/0000-0003-2501-7952; Wetzer, Regina/0000-0003-2674-5150; Collins, Allen/0000-0002-3664-9691; Duffy, J.

Considered one of the most devastating coral disease outbreaks in history, stony coral tissue loss disease (SCTLD) is currently spreading throughout Florida's coral reefs and the greater Caribbean. SCTLD affects at least two dozen different coral species and has been implicated in extensive losses of coral cover. Here we show Pseudoalteromonas sp. strain McH1-7 has broad-spectrum antibacterial activity against SCTLD-associated bacterial isolates. Chemical analyses indicated McH1-7 produces at least two potential antibacterials, korormicin and tetrabromopyrrole, while genomic analysis identified the genes potentially encoding an L-amino acid oxidase and multiple antibacterial metalloproteases (pseudoalterins). During laboratory trials, McH1-7 arrested or slowed disease progression on 68.2% of diseased Montastraea cavernosa fragments treated (n = 22), and it prevented disease transmission by 100% (n = 12). McH1-7 is the most chemically characterized coral probiotic that is an effective prophylactic and direct treatment for the destructive SCTLD as well as a potential alternative to antibiotic use.","[Ushijima, Blake] Univ North Carolina Wilmington, Dept Biol & Marine Biol, Wilmington, NC 28403 USA; [Ushijima, Blake; Gunasekera, Sarath P.; Pitts, Kelly A.; Thompson, Sharon; Sneed, Jennifer M.; Houk, L.

The symbiotic nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria group A (UCYN-A) has been revealed as one of the most abundant and widespread nitrogen-fixers, and includes several sublineages that live associated with genetically distinct but closely related prymnesiophyte hosts. The UCYN-A1 sublineage is associated with an open ocean picoplanktonic prymnesiophyte, whereas UCYN-A2 is associated with the coastal nanoplanktonic coccolithophoreBraarudosphaera bigelowii, suggesting that different sublineages may be adapted to different environments. Here, we study the diversity ofnifHgenes present at the Santa Cruz Municipal Wharf in the Monterey Bay (MB), California, and report for the first time the presence of multiple UCYN-A sublineages, unexpectedly dominated by the UCYN-A2 sublineage. Sequence and quantitative PCR data over an 8-year time-series (2011-2018) showed a shift toward increasing UCYN-A2 abundances after 2013, and a marked seasonality for this sublineage which was present during summer-fall months, coinciding with the upwelling-relaxation period in the MB. Increased abundances corresponded to positive temperature anomalies in MB, and we discuss the possibility of a benthic life stage of the associated coccolithophore host to explain the seasonal pattern. The dominance of UCYN-A2 in coastal waters of the MB underscores the need to further explore the habitat preference of the different sublineages in order to provide additional support for the hypothesis that UCYN-A1 and UCYN-A2 sublineages are different ecotypes.","[Cabello, Ana M.; Turk-Kubo, Kendra A.; Hayashi, Kendra; Jacobs, Lucien; Kudela, Raphael M.; Zehr, Jonathan P.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Ocean Sci Dept, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Cabello, Ana M.] Inst Espanol Oceanog, Ctr Oceanog Malaga, Malaga 29001, Spain","University of California System; University of California Santa Cruz; Spanish Institute of Oceanography","Cabello, AM; Zehr, JP (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Ocean Sci Dept, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.;Cabello, AM (corresponding author), Inst Espanol Oceanog, Ctr Oceanog Malaga, Malaga 29001, Spain.","anamaria.kbyo@gmail.com; jpzehr@gmail.com","; Zehr, Jonathan/B-3513-2014","Cabello Perez, Ana Maria/0000-0002-7165-5632; Turk-Kubo, Kendra/0000-0002-9847-7514; Zehr, Jonathan/0000-0002-5691-5408","Simons Foundation (SCOPE Award) [329108]; Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation [5760]; NSF Biological Oceanography [1559165]; Central and Northern California Ocean Observing System (CeNCOOS) through NOAA Award [NA16NOS0120021]; Directorate For Geosciences [1559165] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Division Of Ocean Sciences [1559165] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Simons Foundation (SCOPE Award); Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation(Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation); NSF Biological Oceanography(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO)); Central and Northern California Ocean Observing System (CeNCOOS) through NOAA Award; Directorate For Geosciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO)); Division Of Ocean Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO))","We gratefully acknowledge Jonathan Magasin for bioinformatics assistance and Dr. Stefan Green at the University of Ilinois DNA Services Facility for next generation sequencing consultation.

Cassiopea medusae specimens from the Western Pacific (Japan and the Philippines) were analysed using multiple lines of complementary evidence, including types of cnidae, macro-morphology and molecular data. These observations lead to the recognition of two distinct species: Cassiopea mayeri, sp. nov. and a previously synonymised variety now raised to species level (Cassiopea culionensis, stat. nov.). These species can be distinguished from each other using morphological features. Herein, sexually dimorphic traits are included for the first time in the descriptions of Cassiopea species. Nematocyst types not previously observed in the genus are also reported. Molecular analyses, based on individual and combined markers (16S + cytochrome c oxidase I, COI), also support two distinct species; they are not sister taxa, and both are nested together within a clade of other Cassiopea members from the Australian and Indo-Pacific regions. Species richness is underestimated in the Western Pacific region, and integrative approaches are helpful to reveal and describe species. The systematics of Cassiopea is far from completely understood, but the present study represents an important further step. http://www.zoobank.org/References/B1A66787-009D-4465-954A-412C6878FCB4.","[Gamero-Mora, Edgar; Morandini, Andre C.] Univ Sao Paulo, Inst Biociencias, Dept Zool, Rua Matao Travessa 14,101, BR-05508090 Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Collins, Allen G.] Smithsonian Inst, Natl Systemat Lab, Natl Ocean & Atmospher Adm, Fisheries Serv,Natl Museum Nat Hist, Washington, DC 20013 USA; [Boco, Sheldon Rey] Griffith Univ, Sch Environm & Sci, Gold Coast Campus, Nathan, Qld 4215, Australia; [Boco, Sheldon Rey] Griffith Univ, Australian Rivers Inst Coasts & Estuaries, Gold Coast Campus, Nathan, Qld 4215, Australia; [Geson, Serafin Mendez] Univ San Carlos, Marine Biol Sect, Cebu, Philippines; [Morandini, Andre C.] Univ Sao Paulo, Ctr Biol Marinha, Rodovia Dr Manoel Hipolito do Rego,Km 131-50, BR-11612109 Sao Sebastiao, SP, Brazil","Universidade de Sao Paulo; Smithsonian Institution; Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Griffith University; Griffith University; University of San Carlos; Universidade de Sao Paulo","Gamero-Mora, E (corresponding author), Univ Sao Paulo, Inst Biociencias, Dept Zool, Rua Matao Travessa 14,101, BR-05508090 Sao Paulo, Brazil.","egamero.mora@gmail.com","Gamero-Mora, Edgar/AAN-7625-2021; Collins, Allen/A-7944-2008; BOCO, SHELDON REY/KZU-9878-2024; Morandini, Andre Carrara/A-9892-2012","Boco, Sheldon Rey/0000-0002-8967-3521; Morandini, Andre Carrara/0000-0003-3747-8748","Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior - Brasil [001, CAPES 238.273.628-30]; CAPES-PROEX; Sao Paulo Research Foundation [FAPESP 2015/21007-9]; Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico [CNPq 309440/2019-0]; National Science Foundation","Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior - Brasil(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)); CAPES-PROEX(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)); Sao Paulo Research Foundation(Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP)); Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF))","This study was funded by the Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior -Brasil -Finance Code 001 (CAPES 238.273.628-30) CAPES-PROEX, Sao Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP 2015/21007-9), and Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq 309440/2019-0).

One system where chromosomal inversions may be important for eco-evolutionary dynamics is in freshwater fishes, which often live in heterogenous environments characterized by varying levels of connectivity and varying opportunities for gene flow. In the present study, reduced representation sequencing was used to study possible adaptation in n = 345 walleye (Sander vitreus) from three North American waterbodies: Cedar Bluff Reservoir (Kansas, USA), Lake Manitoba (Manitoba, Canada), and Lake Winnipeg (Manitoba, Canada). Haplotype and outlier-based tests revealed a putative chromosomal inversion that contained three expressed genes and was nearly fixed in walleye assigned to Lake Winnipeg. These patterns exist despite the potential for high gene flow between these proximate Canadian lakes, suggesting that the inversion may be important for facilitating adaptive divergence between the two lakes despite gene flow. However, a specific adaptive role for the putative inversion could not be tested with the present data. Our study illuminates the importance of genomic architecture consistent with local adaptation in freshwater fishes. Furthermore, our results provide additional evidence that inversions may facilitate local adaptation in many organisms that inhabit connected but heterogenous environments.","[Thorstensen, Matt J.; Jeffrey, Jennifer D.; Treberg, Jason R.; Jeffries, Ken M.] Univ Manitoba, Dept Biol Sci, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N2, Canada; [Euclide, Peter T.; Shi, Yue; Larson, Wesley A.] Univ Wisconsin, US Geol Survey, Wisconsin Cooperat Fishery Res Unit, Coll Nat Resources, Stevens Point, WI USA; [Jeffrey, Jennifer D.] Univ Winnipeg, Richardson Coll, Dept Biol, Winnipeg, MB, Canada; [Shi, Yue] Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Coll Fisheries & Ocean Sci, Juneau, AK USA; [Watkinson, Douglas A.; Enders, Eva C.] Fisheries & Oceans Canada, Freshwater Inst, Winnipeg, MB, Canada; [Larson, Wesley A.] Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, NOAA, Alaska Fisheries Sci Ctr, Auke Bay Labs, Juneau, AK USA; [Kobayashi, Yasuhiro] Ft Hays State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Hays, KS USA; [Kobayashi, Yasuhiro] Coll St Scholast, Dept Biol, Duluth, MN USA","University of Manitoba; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Stevens Point; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; University of Winnipeg; University of Alaska System; University of Alaska Fairbanks; Fisheries & Oceans Canada; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; College of St. Scholastica","Thorstensen, MJ (corresponding author), Univ Manitoba, Dept Biol Sci, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N2, Canada.","matt.thorstensen@gmail.com","Enders, Eva/HLG-6347-2023; Thorstensen, Matt/AAC-8756-2022; Shi, Yue/AAD-7368-2021; Enders, Eva/G-9804-2019","Enders, Eva/0000-0003-2103-0359; Shi, Yue/0000-0002-2860-2666; Thorstensen, Matt/0000-0002-7870-3369; Larson, Wesley/0000-0003-4473-3401; Treberg, Jason/0000-0001-5112-7325; Euclide, Peter/0000-0002-1212-0435","University of Manitoba Faculty of Science [319254]; Canada Research Chairs [223744]; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada [05479, 06052]; Fisheries and Oceans Canada Ocean and Freshwater Science Contribution Program Partnership Fund","University of Manitoba Faculty of Science; Canada Research Chairs(Canada Research ChairsCGIAR); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR); Fisheries and Oceans Canada Ocean and Freshwater Science Contribution Program Partnership Fund","University of Manitoba Faculty of Science, Grant/Award Number: 319254; Canada Research Chairs, Grant/Award Number: 223744; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, Grant/Award Number: 05479 and 06052; Fisheries and Oceans Canada Ocean and Freshwater Science Contribution Program Partnership Fund",NA,114,5,5,0,9,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","2045-7758","","","ECOL EVOL","Ecol.

Teleosts residing in freshwater (FW) environments are faced with the diffusive loss of ions and the osmotic gain of water, and, therefore, the kidney and urinary bladder reabsorb Na+ and Cl- to support the production of dilute urine. Nonetheless, the regulated pathways for Na+ and Cl- transport by euryhaline fishes, especially in the urinary bladder, have not been fully resolved. Here, we first investigated the ultrastructure of epithelial cells within the urinary bladder of FW-acclimated Mozambique tilapia (Oreochromis mossambicus) by electron microscopy. We then investigated whether tilapia employ Na+/Cl- cotransporter 1 (Ncc1) and Clc family Cl- channel 2c (Clc2c) for the reabsorption of Na+ and Cl- by the kidney and urinary bladder. We hypothesized that levels of their associated gene transcripts vary inversely with environmental salinity. In whole kidney and urinary bladder homogenates, ncc1 and clc2c mRNA levels were markedly higher in steady-state FW- versus SW (seawater)-acclimated tilapia. Following transfer from SW to FW, ncc1 and clc2c in both the kidney and urinary bladder were elevated within 48 h. A concomitant increase in branchial ncc2, and decreases in Na+/K+/2Cl(-) cotransporter 1a (nkcc1a) and cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator 1 (cftr1) levels indicated a transition from Na+ and Cl- secretion to absorption by the gills in parallel with the identified renal and urinary bladder responses to FW transfer. Our findings suggest that Ncc1 and Clc2c contribute to the functional plasticity of the kidney and urinary bladder in tilapia.","[Breves, Jason P.; Nelson, Nastasia N.; Koltenyuk, Victor] Skidmore Coll, Dept Biol, 815 N Broadway, Saratoga Springs, NY 12866 USA; [Petro-Sakuma, Cody K.; Celino-Brady, Fritzie T.; Seale, Andre P.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Human Nutr Food & Anim Sci, 1955 East West Rd, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA","Skidmore College; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa","Breves, JP (corresponding author), Skidmore Coll, Dept Biol, 815 N Broadway, Saratoga Springs, NY 12866 USA.","jbreves@skidmore.edu","","Seale, Andre/0000-0003-2398-4201; , Victor Koltenyuk/0009-0003-7526-0894","National Science Foundation [IOS1755131, IOS-1755016]; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration [NA18OAR4170347]; National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases [R21DK111775]; National Institute of Food and Agriculture [HAW02051-H]","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Diabetes & Digestive & Kidney Diseases (NIDDK)); National Institute of Food and Agriculture(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)National Institute of Food and Agriculture)","This study was supported by the National Science Foundation [IOS1755131 to J.P.B. and IOS-1755016 to A.P.S.], the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration [NA18OAR4170347 to A.P.S.], the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases [R21DK111775 to A.P.S.], and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture [Hatch no.

However, a lack of genomic resources and challenges associated with collecting high-quality RNA can limit its application for many wild populations. Minimally invasive blood sampling combined with de novo transcriptomic approaches has great potential to alleviate these barriers. Here, we advance these goals for marine turtles by generating high quality de novo blood transcriptome assemblies to characterize functional diversity and compare global transcriptional profiles between tissues, species, and foraging aggregations.ResultsWe generated high quality blood transcriptome assemblies for hawksbill (Eretmochelys imbricata), loggerhead (Caretta caretta), green (Chelonia mydas), and leatherback (Dermochelys coriacea) turtles. The functional diversity in assembled blood transcriptomes was comparable to those from more traditionally sampled tissues. A total of 31.3% of orthogroups identified were present in all four species, representing a core set of conserved genes expressed in blood and shared across marine turtle species. We observed strong species-specific expression of these genes, as well as distinct transcriptomic profiles between green turtle foraging aggregations that inhabit areas of greater or lesser anthropogenic disturbance.ConclusionsObtaining global gene expression data through non-lethal, minimally invasive sampling can greatly expand the applications of RNA-sequencing in protected long-lived species such as marine turtles. The distinct differences in gene expression signatures between species and foraging aggregations provide insight into the functional genomics underlying the diversity in this ancient vertebrate lineage. The transcriptomic resources generated here can be used in further studies examining the evolutionary ecology and anthropogenic impacts on marine turtles.","[Banerjee, Shreya M.; Stoll, Jamie Adkins; Kenyon, Lauren; Fernandez, Nadia B.; Komoroske, Lisa M.] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Environm Conservat, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Allen, Camryn D.; Martin, Summer; Jones, T.

These conditions were primarily diagnosed through hands-on veterinary examinations and analysis of standard diagnostic panels. In human and veterinary medicine, gene expression profiling has been used to identify molecular mechanisms underlying toxic responses and disease states. Identification of molecular markers of exposure or disease may enable earlier detection of health effects or allow for health evaluation when the use of specialized methodologies is not feasible. To date this powerful tool has not been applied to augment the veterinary data collected concurrently during dolphin health assessments. This study examined transcriptomic profiles of blood from 76 dolphins sampled in health assessments during 2013-2018 in the waters near Barataria Bay, LA and Sarasota Bay, FL. Gene expression was analyzed in conjunction with the substantial suite of health data collected using principal component analysis, differential expression testing, over-representation analysis, and weighted gene co-expression network analysis. Broadly, transcript profiles of Barataria Bay dolphins indicated a shift in immune response, cytoskeletal alterations, and mitochondrial dysfunction, most pronounced in dolphins likely exposed to Deepwater Horizon oiling. While gene expression profiles in Barataria Bay dolphins were altered compared to Sarasota Bay for all years, profiles from 2013 exhibited the greatest alteration in gene expression. Differentially expressed transcripts included genes involved in immunity, inflammation, reproductive failure, and lung or cardiac dysfunction, all of which have been documented in dolphins from Barataria Bay following the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. The genes and pathways identified in this study may, with additional research and validation, prove useful as molecular markers of exposure or disease to assist wildlife veterinarians in evaluating the health of dolphins and other cetaceans.","[Morey, Jeanine S.; Balmer, Brian C.; Zolman, Eric S.; Takeshita, Ryan; Smith, Cynthia R.; Schwacke, Lori H.] Natl Marine Mammal Fdn, Conservat Med, San Diego, CA 92106 USA; [De Guise, Sylvain] Univ Connecticut, Dept Pathobiol & Vet Sci, Storrs, CT USA; [Rowles, Teresa K.] NOAA, Off Protected Resources, NMFS, Silver Spring, MD USA; [Wells, Randall S.] Mote Marine Lab, Chicago Zool Soc, Sarasota Dolphin Res Program, Sarasota, FL 34236 USA; [Balmer, Brian C.] Dolphin Relief & Res, Clancy, MT USA","University of Connecticut; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Mote Marine Laboratory & Aquarium","Morey, JS (corresponding author), Natl Marine Mammal Fdn, Conservat Med, San Diego, CA 92106 USA.","Jeanine.morey@nmmf.org","De Guise, Sylvain/HGF-1052-2022; Balmer, Brian/JEO-9639-2023","Wells, Randall/0000-0001-9793-4181","Gulf of Mexico Research Initiative [SA 18-12]","Gulf of Mexico Research Initiative","This research was made possible by a grant from The Gulf of Mexico Research Initiative https://gulfresearchinitiative.org/) to L.H.S.

In this study, we used phylogeography based on traceback to environmental source locations and comparative genomics to identify features that promoted evolution, dispersal, and competitive dominance of ST36. The major genomic differentiation and competitive success of ST36 were associated with a striking succession of filamentous prophage in the family Inoviridae (inoviruses), including loss of an inovirus prophage that had been maintained for decades in the endemic north Pacific population. Subsequently, at least five distinct progenitors arising from this diversification translocated from the Pacific into the Atlantic and established four geographically defined clonal subpopulations with remarkably low migration or mixing. Founders of two prevailing Atlantic subpopulations each acquired new stable and diagnostic inoviruses while other subpopulations that apparently declined did not. Broader surveys indicate inoviruses are common and active among the global population of V. parahaemolyticus, and though inovirus replacements, such as in ST36, appear to be infrequent, they are notable in pathogenic lineages that dispersed.","[Foxall, Randi L.; Means, Jillian; Marcinkiewicz, Ashely L.; Schillaci, Christopher; DeRosia-Banick, Kristin; Xu, Feng; Hall, Jeffrey A.; Jones, Stephen H.; Cooper, Vaughn S.; Whistler, Cheryl A.] Univ New Hampshire, Northeast Ctr Vibrio Dis & Ecol, Durham, NH 03824 USA; [Foxall, Randi L.; Xu, Feng; Cooper, Vaughn S.; Whistler, Cheryl A.] Univ New Hampshire, Dept Mol Cellular & Biomed Sci, Durham, NH 03824 USA; [Means, Jillian; Marcinkiewicz, Ashely L.] Univ New Hampshire, Grad Program Microbiol, Durham, NH USA; [Schillaci, Christopher; Jones, Stephen H.] Univ New Hampshire, Dept Nat Resources & Environm, Durham, NH USA; [Hall, Jeffrey A.] Univ New Hampshire, Hubbard Ctr Genome Studies, Durham, NH USA; [Cooper, Vaughn S.] Univ Pittsburgh, Sch Med, Dept Microbiol & Mol Genet, Pittsburgh, PA USA; [Means, Jillian] Synlogic Inc, Cambridge, MA USA; [Marcinkiewicz, Ashely L.] Wadsworth Ctr, Dept Hlth, Div Infect Dis, Albany, NY USA; [Schillaci, Christopher] NOAA Fisheries Serv, Greater Atlantic Reg Fisheries Off, Gloucester, MA USA; [DeRosia-Banick, Kristin] George Washington Univ, Milken Sch Publ Hlth, Washington, DC USA; [Xu, Feng] Childrens Hosp Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA USA","University System Of New Hampshire; University of New Hampshire; University System Of New Hampshire; University of New Hampshire; University System Of New Hampshire; University of New Hampshire; University System Of New Hampshire; University of New Hampshire; University System Of New Hampshire; University of New Hampshire; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh; Wadsworth Center; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; George Washington University; University of Pennsylvania; Pennsylvania Medicine; Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia","Whistler, CA (corresponding author), Univ New Hampshire, Northeast Ctr Vibrio Dis & Ecol, Durham, NH 03824 USA.;Whistler, CA (corresponding author), Univ New Hampshire, Dept Mol Cellular & Biomed Sci, Durham, NH 03824 USA.","cheryl.whistler@unh.edu","DeRosia-Banick, Kristin/IQS-5503-2023; Xu, Feng/AAX-6356-2021","Whistler, Cheryl/0000-0002-2301-2069; Cooper, Vaughn/0000-0001-7726-0765","UNH | New Hampshire Sea Grant, University of New Hampshire (NHSG) [R/SFA-4, R-HCE-3, R/SFA-13]; National Sea Grant College Program [2995]; New Hampshire Agricultural Experimentation Station [NH00609, 233555, NH00625, 1004199, NH00658, 1013479, 1023165]; USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture Hatch projects; Fish and Game Department","UNH | New Hampshire Sea Grant, University of New Hampshire (NHSG); National Sea Grant College Program(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); New Hampshire Agricultural Experimentation Station; USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture Hatch projects; Fish and Game Department","Partial funding was provided by the National Sea Grant College Program and projects R/SFA-4, R-HCE-3, and R/SFA-13 and by the New Hampshire Agricultural Experimentation Station.

To address how key hormones that regulate growth and reproduction interact in teleost fishes, we studied Mozambique tilapia (Oreochromis mossambicus) to determine whether the activities of luteinizing hormone (Lh) are modulated by growth hormone (Gh), and conversely, whether targets of Gh are affected by the presence of Lh. In particular, we examined how gonadal morphology and specific gene transcripts responded to ovine GH (oGH) and/or LH (oLH) in hypophysectomized male and female tilapia. Hypophysectomized females exhibited a diminished gonadosomatic index (GSI) concomitant with ovarian follicular atresia. The combination of oGH and oLH restored GSI and ovarian morphology to conditions observed in sham-operated controls. A similar pattern was observed for GSI in males. In control fish, gonadal gh receptor (ghr2) and estrogen receptor beta (er beta) expression was higher in females versus males. A combination of oGH and oLH restored er beta and ar beta in females. In males, testicular insulin-like growth factor 3 (igf3) expression was reduced following hypophysectomy and subsequently restored to control levels by either oGH or oLH. By contrast, the combination of both hormones was required to recover ovarian igf3 expression in females. In muscle, ghr2 expression was more responsive to oGH in males versus females. In the liver of hypophysectomized males, igf2 expression was diminished by both oGH and oLH; there was no effect of hypophysectomy, oGH, or oLH on igf2 expression in females. Collectively, our results indicate that gene transcripts associated with growth and reproduction exhibit sex-specific responses to oGH and oLH. These responses reflect, at least in part, how hor-mones mediate trade-offs between growth and reproduction, and thus sexual dimorphism, in teleost fishes.","[Celino-Brady, Fritzie T.; Seale, Andre P.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Human Nutr Food & Anim Sci, 1955 East West Rd, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Breves, Jason P.] Skidmore Coll, Dept Biol, 815 N Broadway, Saratoga Springs, NY 12866 USA","University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; Skidmore College","Seale, AP (corresponding author), Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Human Nutr Food & Anim Sci, 1955 East West Rd, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.","seale@hawaii.edu","","","National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration [NA18OAR4170347]; National Insti-tute of Food and Agriculture [HAW02051-H]; National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases [R21DK111775]; National Science Foundation [IOS-1755016, IOS-1755131]; National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities [U54MD007601]","National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); National Insti-tute of Food and Agriculture(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)National Institute of Food and Agriculture); National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Diabetes & Digestive & Kidney Diseases (NIDDK)); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Minority Health & Health Disparities (NIMHD))","This work was supported in part by grants from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NA18OAR4170347) , National Institute of Food and Agriculture (HAW02051-H) , National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (R21DK111775) to A.P.S., National Science Foundation (IOS-1755016) to A.P.S and (IOS-1755131) to J.P.B., and National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities (U54MD007601) to Histology and Imaging Core Facility, John A.

Less is known about the evolutionary consequences of ecosystem size. A few studies have shown that ecosystem size shapes the evolution of trophic diversity by shaping habitat heterogeneity, but the effects of ecosystem size on antipredator trait evolution have not been explored. Ecosystem size may impact antipredator trait evolution by shaping predator presence (larger ecosystems have longer food chains) and habitat complexity (larger ecosystems may have more diverse habitat structure). We tested these effects using threespine stickleback from bar-built estuaries along the Central Coast of California. These stickleback populations are polymorphic forEctodysplasin-A(Eda), a gene that controls bony lateral plates used as antipredator defense. We inferredEdagenotypes from lateral plate phenotypes and show that the frequency of the complete (C) allele, which is associated with greater number of lateral plates, increases as a function of ecosystem size. Predator presence and habitat complexity are both correlated to ecosystem size. The strongest proximate predictor ofEdaallele frequencies was the presence of predatory fishes (steelhead trout and sculpin). Counter to expectations, habitat complexity did not have a strong modifying effect onEdaallele frequencies. Our results point to the importance of ecosystem size for determining predator presence as being the primary pathway to evolutionary effects. Ecosystem size has received much attention in ecology. Our work shows that it may be an important determinant of adaptive evolution in wild populations.","[Wasserman, Ben A.; Apgar, Travis M.; Palkovacs, Eric P.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Paccard, Antoine] McGill Univ, McGill Genome Ctr, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Des Roches, Simone] Univ Washington, Dept Urban Design & Planning, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Barrett, Rowan D.

The recent accumulation of genomic data provides promising opportunities to understand the genomic landscape of divergence, which describes the distribution of differences across genomes. Genomic areas of unusually high differentiation have been called genomic islands of divergence. Their formation has been attributed to a variety of mechanisms, but a prominent hypothesis is that they result from divergent selection over a small portion of the genome, with surrounding areas homogenized by gene flow. Such islands have often been interpreted as being associated with divergence with gene flow. However, other mechanisms related to genomic structure and population history can also contribute to the formation of genomic islands of divergence. We currently lack a quantitative framework to examine the dynamics of genomic landscapes under the complex and nuanced conditions that are found in natural systems. Here, we develop an individual-based simulation to explore the dynamics of diverging genomes under various scenarios of gene flow, selection and genotype-phenotype maps. Our modelling results are consistent with empirical observations demonstrating the formation of genomic islands under genetic isolation. Importantly, we have quantified the range of conditions that produce genomic islands. We demonstrate that the initial level of genetic diversity, drift, time since divergence, linkage disequilibrium, strength of selection and gene flow are all important factors that can influence the formation of genomic islands. Because the accumulation of genomic differentiation over time tends to erode the signal of genomic islands, genomic islands are more likely to be observed in recently divergent taxa, although not all recently diverged taxa will necessarily exhibit islands of genomic divergence. Gene flow primarily slows the swamping of islands of divergence with time. By using this framework, further studies may explore the relative influence of particular suites of events that contribute to the emergence of genomic islands under sympatric, parapatric and allopatric conditions. This approach represents a novel tool to explore quantitative expectations of the speciation process, and should prove useful in elucidating past and projecting future genomic evolution of any taxa.","[Quilodran, Claudio S.; Ruegg, Kristen; Sendell-Price, Ashley T.; Coulson, Tim; Clegg, Sonya M.] Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Oxford, England; [Ruegg, Kristen] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Inst Environm & Sustainabil, Ctr Trop Res, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Ruegg, Kristen] Colorado State Univ, Dept Biol, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Anderson, Eric C.] Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Fisheries Ecol Div, Southwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, NOAA, Santa Cruz, CA USA","University of Oxford; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; Colorado State University; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA","Quilodrn, CS (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Oxford, England.","claudio.quilodran@zoo.ox.ac.uk","Coulson, Tim/AAL-8148-2021; Sendell-Price, Ashley/AAV-3061-2021; Clegg, Sonya/A-8011-2013; Quilodran, Claudio/JVO-8631-2024","Ruegg, Kristen/0000-0001-5579-941X; Quilodran Venegas, Claudio Sebastian/0000-0001-7197-9154","Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Forderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung [P2GEP3_168973, P400PB_183930]; Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF) [P400PB_183930, P2GEP3_168973] Funding Source: Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF)","Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Forderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF)(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF))","Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Forderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung, Grant/Award Number: P2GEP3_168973 and P400PB_183930",NA,86,16,18,1,26,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","2041-210X","2041-2096","","METHODS ECOL EVOL","Methods Ecol.

Intraspecific variation, which includes the genomic and phenotypic diversity found within and among populations, is threatened by local extinctions, abundance declines, and anthropogenic selection. However, biodiversity assessments often fail to highlight this loss of diversity within species. We review the literature on how intraspecific variation supports critical ecological functions and nature's contributions to people (NCP). Results show that the main categories of NCP (material, non-material, and regulating) are supported by intraspecific variation. We highlight new strategies that are needed to further explore these connections and to make explicit the value of intraspecific variation for NCP. These strategies will require collaboration with local and Indigenous groups who possess critical knowledge on the relationships between intraspecific variation and ecosystem function. New genomic methods provide a promising set of tools to uncover hidden variation. Urgent action is needed to document, conserve, and restore the intraspecific variation that supports nature and people. Thus, we propose that the maintenance and restoration of intraspecific variation should be raised to a major global conservation objective. This Perspective highlights how conservation of intraspecific variation is critical for sustaining nature's contributions to people.","[Des Roches, Simone; Shapiro, Beth; Palkovacs, Eric P.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Pendleton, Linwood H.] Ctr Fourth Ind Revolut Ocean, Lysaker, Norway; [Pendleton, Linwood H.] Univ Western Brittany, CNRS, UMR 6308, Ifremer,AMURE,IUEM, Plouzane, France; [Pendleton, Linwood H.] Univ Queensland, Global Change Inst, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Pendleton, Linwood H.] Duke Univ, Durham, NC USA; [Shapiro, Beth] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Des Roches, Simone] Univ Washington, Sch Aquat & Fisheries Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","University of California System; University of California Santa Cruz; Ifremer; Universite de Bretagne Occidentale; Institut Universitaire Europeen de la Mer (IUEM); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Ecology & Environment (INEE); University of Queensland; Duke University; Howard Hughes Medical Institute; University of California System; University of California Santa Cruz; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle","Palkovacs, EP (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.","epalkova@ucsc.edu","Roches, Simone/A-4814-2011","Pendleton, Linwood/0000-0001-9298-0461; Shapiro, Beth/0000-0002-2733-7776; Des Roches, Simone/0000-0002-5360-8197","European Institute for Marine Studies' International Chair for Marine Ecosystem Services through the French Agency for National Research's Investissements d'avenir ISblue [ANR-17-EURE-0015]; LabexMER [//ANR/-/-10/-/LABX/-/19]; University of California Office of the President grant for the Institute for the Study of Ecological and Evolutionary Climate Impacts; NOAA Cooperative Institute for Marine Ecosystems and Climate","European Institute for Marine Studies' International Chair for Marine Ecosystem Services through the French Agency for National Research's Investissements d'avenir ISblue(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)); LabexMER; University of California Office of the President grant for the Institute for the Study of Ecological and Evolutionary Climate Impacts; NOAA Cooperative Institute for Marine Ecosystems and Climate(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA)","An initial research meeting to launch the paper was funded by the European Institute for Marine Studies' International Chair for Marine Ecosystem Services through the French Agency for National Research's Investissements d'avenir ISblue (ANR-17-EURE-0015) and the LabexMER (//ANR/-/-10/-/LABX/-/19).

Richness of the olfactory repertoire depends on the diversity of receptors coded by homologous genes classified into four families: OR, TAAR, VR1, and VR2. Herein, we focus on the OR gene repertoire. While independent large contractions of the OR gene repertoire associated with ecological transitions have been found in mammals, little is known about the diversity of the OR gene repertoire and its evolution in teleost fishes, a group that includes more than 34,000 living species. We analyzed genomes of 163 species representing diversity in this large group. We found a large range of variation in the number of functional OR genes, from 15 in the Broad-nose Pipefish Syngnathus typhle and the Ocean Sunfish Mola mola, to 429 in the Zig-zag Eel Mastacembelus armatus. The number of OR genes was higher in species when a multilamellar olfactory rosette was present. Moreover, the number of lamellae was correlated with the richness of the OR gene repertoire. While a slow and balanced birth-and-death process generally drives the evolution of the OR gene repertoire, we inferred several episodes of high rates of gene loss, sometimes followed by large gains in the number of OR genes. These gains coincide with morphological changes of the olfactory organ and suggest a strong functional association between changes in the morphology and the evolution of the OR gene repertoire.","[Policarpo, Maxime; Sandoz, Jean-Christophe; Casane, Didier] Univ Paris Saclay, CNRS, IRD, UMR Evolut Genomes Comportement & Ecol, Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Bemis, Katherine E.] Smithsonian Inst, NOAA, Natl Systemat Lab, Natl Museum Nat Hist, Washington, DC 20560 USA; [Tyler, James C.] Smithsonian Inst, Dept Paleobiol, Natl Museum Nat Hist, Washington, DC 20560 USA; [Metcalfe, Cushla J.] POB 21, Nambour, Qld, Australia; [Laurenti, Patrick] Univ Paris, Lab Interdisciplinaire Energies Demain, Paris, France; [Retaux, Sylvie] Univ Paris Saclay, Inst Neurosci Paris Saclay, CNRS, Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Casane, Didier] Univ Paris, UFR Sci Vivant, Paris, France","Universite Paris Cite; Universite Paris Saclay; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Smithsonian Institution; Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History; Smithsonian Institution; Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History; Universite Paris Cite; Universite Paris Cite; Universite Paris Saclay; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite Paris Cite","Casane, D (corresponding author), Univ Paris Saclay, CNRS, IRD, UMR Evolut Genomes Comportement & Ecol, Gif Sur Yvette, France.","didier.casane@egce.cnrs-gif.fr","Metcalfe, Cushla/D-2476-2013; Policarpo, Maxime/ABH-7036-2020; Laurenti, Patrick/I-8785-2012; SANDOZ, Jean-Christophe/A-6085-2012","Bemis, Katherine/0000-0002-7471-9283; Laurenti, Patrick/0000-0002-2903-1148; SANDOZ, Jean-Christophe/0000-0002-5423-9645; Policarpo, Maxime/0000-0001-8057-7800","","","",NA,59,9,9,0,17,"OXFORD UNIV PRESS","OXFORD","GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","0737-4038","1537-1719","","MOL BIOL EVOL","Mol.

However, empirical assessments of genomic landscapes under varying evolutionary scenarios that are knowna prioriare few, thereby limiting our ability to achieve this goal. Here we combine RAD-sequencing and individual-based simulations to evaluate the genomic landscape of divergence in the silvereye (Zosterops lateralis). Using pairwise comparisons that differ in divergence timeframe and the presence or absence of gene flow, we document how genomic patterns accumulate along the speciation continuum. In contrast to previous predictions, our results provide limited support for the idea that divergence accumulates around loci under divergent selection or that genomic islands widen with time. While a small number of genomic islands were found in populations diverging with and without gene flow, in few cases were SNPs putatively under selection tightly associated with genomic islands. The transition from localized to genome-wide levels of divergence was captured using individual-based simulations that considered only neutral processes. Our results challenge the ubiquity of existing verbal models that explain the accumulation of genomic differences across the speciation continuum and instead support the idea that divergence both within and outside of genomic islands is important during the speciation process.","[Sendell-Price, Ashley T.; Ruegg, Kristen C.; Quilodran, Claudio S.; Van Doren, Benjamin M.; Coulson, Tim; Clegg, Sonya M.] Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Zoology Res & Adm Bldg,11a Mansfield Rd, Oxford OX1 3SZ, England; [Ruegg, Kristen C.; Underwood, Vinh L.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Inst Environm & Sustainabil, Ctr Trop Res, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA; [Ruegg, Kristen C.] Colorado State Univ, Dept Biol, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Anderson, Eric C.] NOAA, Fisheries Ecol Div, Southwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Santa Cruz, CA USA; [Clegg, Sonya M.] Griffith Univ, Environm Futures Res Inst, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia","University of Oxford; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; Colorado State University; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Griffith University","Sendell-Price, AT (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Zoology Res & Adm Bldg,11a Mansfield Rd, Oxford OX1 3SZ, England.","ashley.sendell-price@zoo.ox.ac.uk","Clegg, Sonya/A-8011-2013; Quilodran, Claudio/JVO-8631-2024; Sendell-Price, Ashley/AAV-3061-2021; Coulson, Tim/AAL-8148-2021; Clegg, Sonya/F-5504-2015; Van Doren, Benjamin/R-7761-2018","Quilodran Venegas, Claudio Sebastian/0000-0001-7197-9154; Coulson, Tim/0000-0001-9371-9003; Clegg, Sonya/0000-0002-3092-3864; Ruegg, Kristen/0000-0001-5579-941X; Sendell-Price, Ashley/0000-0002-1227-8929; Underwood, Vinh/0000-0002-2526-1851; Van Doren, Benjamin/0000-0002-7355-6005","John Fell Oxford University Press Research Fund; Natural Environment Research Council (NERC); Swiss National Science Foundation [P2GEP3_168973, P400PB_183930]; Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF) [P400PB_183930, P2GEP3_168973] Funding Source: Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF)","John Fell Oxford University Press Research Fund; Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF)(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF))","This work was funded by a grant from the John Fell Oxford University Press Research Fund to T.C. and S.M.C., with additional support from an anonymous donation to K.C.R. and a Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) studentship awarded to A.T.S.P.

In subsequent investigations, none of these characters proved diagnostic, and species assignments were based on capture location. Two recent studies applied conservation genomics to assess species boundaries and reached contrasting conclusions: an ezRAD phylogenetic study resolved 5 lineages with poor alignment to species categories and proposed a single species with multiple population partitions. In contrast, a dd-RAD coalescent study concluded that the three nominal species are well-supported evolutionarily lineages. Here we developed a draft genome (similar to 1.229 Gbp) to apply genome-wide coverage (10,246 SNPs) with nearly range-wide sampling of specimens (G. robusta N=266, G. intermedia N=241, and G. nigra N=117) to resolve this debate. All three nominal species were polyphyletic, whereas 5 of 8 watersheds were monophyletic. AMOVA partitioned 23.1% of genetic variance among nominal species, 30.9% among watersheds, and the Little Colorado River was highly distinct (F-ST ranged from 0.79 to 0.88 across analyses). Likewise, DAPC identified watersheds as more distinct than species, with the Little Colorado River having 297 fixed nucleotide differences compared to zero fixed differences among the three nominal species. In every analysis, geography explains more of the observed variance than putative taxonomy, and there are no diagnostic molecular or morphological characters to justify species designation. Our analysis reconciles previous work by showing that species identities based on type location are supported by significant divergence, but natural geographic partitions show consistently greater divergence. Thus, our data confirm Gila robusta as a single polytypic species with roughly a dozen highly isolated geographic populations, providing a strong scientific basis for watershed-based future conservation.","[Suchocki, Christopher R.; Ka'apu-Lyons, Cassie; Copus, Joshua M.; Walsh, Cameron A.

The lanternfishes (Myctophidae) are a speciose, yet understudied, taxonomic group, that comprise a significant portion of the global deep-sea biomass, making them integral members of meso- and bathy-pelagic food webs. Herein, we used a genomic approach (double digest restriction site associated DNA sequencing) to investigate the temporal genetic dynamics of three species of lanternfishes within the northern GOM in the region of the oil spill: Ceratoscopelus warmingii (N = 65, SNP = 1804), Diaphus dumerilii (N = 42, SNP = 2577), and Lepidophanes guentheri (N = 44, SNP = 3462). Fishes were sampled in 2011, and then again in 2015, and 2016, and genotyped using single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) markers. An additional 22 C. warmingii samples collected in 2014 from the western North Atlantic were used to assess genetic connectivity between these two regions. Overall, all three species were characterized by low levels of genetic diversity and high inbreeding coefficients, and within two of the three species (C. warmingii and L. guentheri), little (if any) evidence of population genetic structure was found within northern GOM waters. Conversely, significant intra-GOM genetic population structure was found for D. dumerilii, highlighting the need for a more robust population genetic survey of these fishes within the GOM to understand how populations of these fishes may respond to future environmental perturbations. In addition, significant genetic population structure was also found between subpopulations of C. warmingii from the northern GOM and western North Atlantic; with evidence of a mixture of two genetic populations co-occurring within the western North Atlantic. Given the potential for future environmental perturbations caused by expanding oil and gas extraction and climate change on GOM mesopelagic communities, rigorous population genetic assessments are required to understand the population dynamics of fishes and to safeguard the genetic diversity and resilience of this functionally important group of deep-sea fishes.","[Bernard, Andrea M.; Finnegan, Kimberly A.; Shivji, Mahmood S.] Nova Southeastern Univ, Save Our Seas Fdn, Shark Res Ctr, 8000 North Ocean Dr, Dania, FL 33004 USA; [Bernard, Andrea M.; Finnegan, Kimberly A.; Shivji, Mahmood S.] Nova Southeastern Univ, Guy Harvey Res Inst, 8000 North Ocean Dr, Dania, FL 33004 USA; [Sutton, Tracey T.] Nova Southeastern Univ, 8000 North Ocean Dr, Dania, FL 33004 USA; [Eytan, Ron, I; Weber, Max D.] Texas A&M Univ Galveston, 1001 Texas Clipper Rd, Galveston, TX 77550 USA","Nova Southeastern University; Nova Southeastern University; Nova Southeastern University; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station","Shivji, MS (corresponding author), Nova Southeastern Univ, Save Our Seas Fdn, Shark Res Ctr, 8000 North Ocean Dr, Dania, FL 33004 USA.;Shivji, MS (corresponding author), Nova Southeastern Univ, Guy Harvey Res Inst, 8000 North Ocean Dr, Dania, FL 33004 USA.","andrbern@nova.edu; atwaterk5@gmail.com; tsutton1@nova.edu; mweb68@hotmail.com; mahmood@nova.edu","Shivji, Mahmood/G-4080-2013; Sutton, Tracey/AAW-7644-2021","","National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's RESTORE Science Program [NA19NOS4510193]; Gulf of Mexico Research Initiative [SA 15-21]; Save Our Seas Foundation Program Grant [157]; Guy Harvey Ocean Foundation","National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's RESTORE Science Program(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); Gulf of Mexico Research Initiative; Save Our Seas Foundation Program Grant; Guy Harvey Ocean Foundation","This research was made possible in part by a grant from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's RESTORE Science Program under award NA19NOS4510193 to Nova Southeastern University, in part by The Gulf of Mexico Research Initiative (SA 15-21), and accessory financial support from the Save Our Seas Foundation Program Grant 157 and Guy Harvey Ocean Foundation.

P. decorus causes bronchointerstitial pneumonia, respiratory distress, reduced ability to swim, dive and hunt and as a result, increased mortality particularly in young animals. Respiratory disease is a leading cause of stranding and admission to rehabilitation centers on the Pacific coast. Low-coverage genomic sequencing of four P. decorus individuals analyzed through Galaxy's RepeatExplorer identified a novel repeat DNA family we employed to design a sensitive quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay for diagnosing infections from fecal or sputum samples. The assay detects as little as 10 fg of P. decorus DNA and a linear regression model developed using a standard curve can be used to estimate the concentration of P. decorus DNA in a sample, +/- 0.015 ng. This knowledge can be leveraged to estimate the level of parasite burden, which can be used to design improved treatments for animals in rehabilitation. Improved treatment of infections will aid in more animals being successfully released back into the wild.","[Williams, Kalani M.; Fessler, M. K.; Bloomfield, R.

We aim to test for a relationship between biogeographic patterns in the shell phenotypes of an over-exploited shellfish and the presence of humans to identify human-mediated adaptive trade-offs. The implications of these trade-offs are discussed with respect to the sustainability of the fishery. Taxon: The endemic Hawaiian intertidal limpet, 'opihi makaiauli (Patellagastropoda, Nacellidae, Cellana exarata) Methods: We surveyed phenotypic characters associated with temperature and predation avoidance across the entire species range and tested for differences in the relationship between these characters and latitude, on islands with and without humans. Results: Among all limpets surveyed, there was a bimodal distribution in shell colour (light, dark) and a parapatric pattern of shell coloration across the archipelago with lighter shells being prevalent on the uninhabited islands and darker, more camouflaged shells being prevalent on the inhabited islands. On the cooler, uninhabited islands, all morphometric characters associated with thermal avoidance (surface area, height and doming) increased with decreasing latitude. On the hotter, inhabited islands, however, shells were flatter, less variable and less adapted for avoiding thermal stress than predation. Main Conclusions: The biogeographic patterns in shell phenotype and previous genetic studies suggest that the population is beginning to bifurcate in response to disruptive and directional selection as well as geographic isolation between the islands with and without humans. Decreased phenotypic and genetic diversity on the inhabited islands despite much larger populations of 'opihi suggests a prominent historical bottleneck. The prevalence of maladaptive dark, flat phenotypes for thermal avoidance on the inhabited islands suggests that predation is a stronger selective force, driving adaptive trade-offs in shape and colour. We propose that this is likely a case of fisheries-induced evolution and a millennium of harvesting is the most likely selective pressure driving the observed biogeographic patterns in shell morphology. The flatter, darker shells will allow body temperatures to rise higher in direct sunlight, therefore we hypothesize that the thermal niche of 'opihi is narrower on inhabited islands and will continue to narrow as Earth warms.","[Hamilton, Ashley M.; Selwyn, Jason D.; Hamner, Rebecca M.; Bird, Christopher E.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Life Sci, 6300 Ocean Dr, Corpus Christi, TX 78411 USA; [Hamner, Rebecca M.] CNMI Div Fish & Wildlife, Rota, CM USA; [Johnson, Hokuala K.; Brown, Tia] NOAA, Papahanaumokuakea Marine Natl Monument, Off Marine Natl Sanctuaries, Honolulu, HI USA; [Springer, Shauna K.] Hawaii Program, Conservat Int Ctr Ocean, Honolulu, HI USA","Texas A&M University System; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA","Bird, CE (corresponding author), Texas A&M Univ, Dept Life Sci, 6300 Ocean Dr, Corpus Christi, TX 78411 USA.","cbird@tamucc.edu","","Selwyn, Jason/0000-0002-9100-217X","U.S. Army Corps of Engineers [W9126G-12-2-0066]; Division of Computer and Network Systems [NSF-MRI-CNS-0821475]; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration [15PIRSK23]; Division of Human Resource Development [NSF-HRD-1304975]; U.S. Department of Commerce [W9126G-12-2-0066]; National Science Foundation [15PIRSK23, 515]","U.S. Army Corps of Engineers(United States Department of DefenseUnited States Army); Division of Computer and Network Systems(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE)); National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); Division of Human Resource Development(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for STEM Education (EDU)); U.S. Department of Commerce; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF))","U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Grant/Award Number: W9126G-12-2-0066; Division of Computer and Network Systems, Grant/Award Number: NSF-MRI-CNS-0821475; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Grant/Award Number: 15PIRSK23; Division of Human Resource Development, Grant/Award Number: NSF-HRD-1304975; U.S. Department of Commerce, Grant/Award Number: W9126G-12-2-0066,; National Science Foundation, Grant/Award Number: 15PIRSK23 and 515",NA,117,6,7,1,23,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","0305-0270","1365-2699","","J BIOGEOGR","J.

Understanding life history is important especially considering adult bonefishes in Hawai'i are highly sought gamefish valued for their tenacious fight on rod-and-reel and delicate taste. In this study light traps were used to capture leptocephali at three nearshore locations around O'ahu, Hawai'i. Across 130 + h of trapping, 59 larvae were captured, most during 2000-2100 h on rising tides. Lengths ranged from 54 to 66 mm, indicating late stage I larvae. Otolith analyses (N = 26) revealed ages from 28 to 72 days with an average age of about 48 days. Genetic species identification on a subset of the larvae showed that one of 28 total specimens was Albula virgata, which is endemic to Hawai'i, and the remaining were the Indo-Pacific A. glossodonta. Along with calm inshore waters, estuarine habitat appears to be a critical element for leptocephali recruitment success. Reducing impacts to these estuarine habitats and protecting and restoring freshwater input may have positive impacts on leptocephali recruitment, the essential starting point for thriving bonefish fisheries in Hawai'i.","[Kamikawa, Keith; Bowen, Brian W.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Hawaii Inst Marine Biol, Honolulu, HI 96744 USA; [Humphreys, Robert] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Marine Biol Grad Program, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Peyton, Kimberly] Hawaii Div Aquat Resources, Honolulu, HI 96819 USA; [Kobayashi, Donald] NOAA Pacific Isl Fisheries Sci Ctr, Honolulu, HI 96818 USA","University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA","Kamikawa, K (corresponding author), Univ Hawaii Manoa, Hawaii Inst Marine Biol, Honolulu, HI 96744 USA.","keitht.kamikawa@gmail.com","","","Office of Graduate Student Assistantships and Fellowships, George Washington University; Hawaii Department of Forestry and Wildlife","Office of Graduate Student Assistantships and Fellowships, George Washington University; Hawaii Department of Forestry and Wildlife","Thank you to Allan Yoshimoto, Christopher Haak, and Matthew Ramsey for the assistance with light trap design, deployment recommendations, and participating in sampling.

This disease, stony coral tissue loss disease (SCTLD), affects at least 22 coral species causing the progressive destruction of tissue. The etiological agents responsible for SCTLD are unidentified, but pathogenic bacteria are suspected. Virulence screens of 400 isolates identified four potentially pathogenic strains of Vibrio spp. subsequently identified as V. coralliilyticus. Strains of this species are known coral pathogens; however, cultures were unable to consistently elicit tissue loss, suggesting an opportunistic role. Using an improved immunoassay, the VcpA RapidTest, a toxic zinc-metalloprotease produced by V. coralliilyticus was detected on 22.3% of diseased Montastraea cavernosa (n = 67) and 23.5% of diseased Orbicella faveolata (n = 24). VcpA(+) corals had significantly higher mortality rates and faster disease progression. For VcpA(-) fragments, 21.6% and 33.3% of M. cavernosa and O. faveolata, respectively, died within 21 d of observation, while 100% of similarly sized VcpA(+) fragments of both species died during the same period. Further physiological and genomic analysis found no apparent differences between the Atlantic V. coralliilyticus strains cultured here and pathogens from the Indo-Pacific but highlighted the diversity among strains and their immense genetic potential. In all, V. coralliilyticus may be causing coinfections that exacerbate existing SCTLD lesions, which could contribute to the intraspecific differences observed between colonies. This study describes potential coinfections contributing to SCTLD virulence as well as diagnostic tools capable of tracking the pathogen involved, which are important contributions to the management and understanding of SCTLD.","[Ushijima, Blake; Thompson, Sharon; Pitts, Kelly; Weatherup, Elizabeth; Reu, Jacqueline; Wetzell, Raquel; Aeby, Greta S.; Paul, Valerie J.] Smithsonian Marine Stn, Ft Pierce, FL 34949 USA; [Meyer, Julie L.; Tittl, Jessica] Univ Florida, Soil & Water Sci Dept, Gainesville, FL USA; [Marusich, Michael F.] mAbDx Inc, Eugene, OR USA; [Hase, Claudia C.] Oregon State Univ, Carlson Coll Vet Med, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA","Smithsonian Institution; Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History; State University System of Florida; University of Florida; Oregon State University","Ushijima, B (corresponding author), Smithsonian Marine Stn, Ft Pierce, FL 34949 USA.","ushijimab@uncw.edu","Marusich, Michael/AAQ-3447-2020; Tittl, Jessica/GVR-7843-2022; Meyer, Julie/D-1021-2010","Pitts, Kelly A/0000-0002-8555-0719; Meyer, Julie/0000-0003-3382-3321; Paul, Valerie/0000-0002-4691-1569","Florida Department of Environmental Protection Office of Resilience and Coastal Protection-Southeast Region; Smithsonian George E.

Abiotic data taken directly after the event suggested that acute deoxygenation contributed to the mortality. Despite the large impact of this event on the coral community, there was no direct evidence that this LME was driven by acute deoxygenation, and thus we explored whether gene expression responses of corals to the LME would indicate what abiotic factors may have contributed to the LME. Gene expression of affected and unaffected corals sampled during the mortality event revealed evidence of the physiological consequences of the LME on coral hosts and their algal symbionts from two congeneric species (Orbicella franksi and Orbicella faveolata). Affected colonies of both species differentially regulated genes involved in mitochondrial regulation and oxidative stress. To further test the hypothesis that deoxygenation led to the LME, we measured coral host and algal symbiont gene expression in response to ex situ experimental deoxygenation (control = 6.9 +/- 0.08 mg L-1, anoxic = 0.083 +/- 0.017 mg L-1) in healthy O. faveolata colonies from the FGB. However, this deoxygenation experiment revealed divergent gene expression patterns compared to the corals sampled during the LME and was more similar to a generalized coral environmental stress response. It is therefore likely that while the LME was connected to low oxygen, it was a series of interconnected stressors that elicited the unique gene expression responses observed here. These in situ and ex situ data highlight how field responses to stressors are unique from those in controlled laboratory conditions, and that the complexities of deoxygenation events in the field likely arise from interactions between multiple environmental factors simultaneously. In July 2016, East Bank of Flower Garden Banks (FGB) National Marine Sanctuary experienced a localized mortality event (LME) of multiple invertebrate species that ultimately led to reductions in coral cover, the source of which was unknown but suspected to be related to deoxygenation. Gene expression of reef-building corals directly following the event was measured, as well as in a controlled deoxygenation experiment ex situ. We found that gene expression patterns during the LME and were more similar to a generalized coral environmental stress response than to deoxygenation, therefore, while the LME was connected to low oxygen, it was more likely due to a series of interconnected stressors that elicited the unique gene expression responses observed here.image","[Strader, Marie E.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Biol, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Wright, Rachel M.] Southern Methodist Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Dallas, TX USA; [Pezner, Ariel K.] Smithsonian Marine Stn, Ft Pierce, FL USA; [Nuttall, Marissa F.] Flower Garden Banks Natl Marine Sanctuary, Galveston, TX USA; [Aichelman, Hannah E.; Davies, Sarah W.] Boston Univ, Dept Biol, Boston, MA 02215 USA","Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; Southern Methodist University; Smithsonian Institution; Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Boston University","Strader, ME (corresponding author), Texas A&M Univ, Dept Biol, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.;Davies, SW (corresponding author), Boston Univ, Dept Biol, Boston, MA 02215 USA.","stradermarie@gmail.com; daviessw@gmail.com","","Strader, Marie/0000-0002-1886-4187; Wright, Rachel/0000-0002-5867-1224; Pezner, Ariel/0000-0002-6076-7049","Life Sciences Research Fellowship","Life Sciences Research Fellowship","We would like to thank and acknowledge Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary for research facilitation and permitting, the crew of the R/V Manta for offshore research support, and the Marchetti lab at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill for use of their molecular lab for library preparations.

However, monitoring cyanobacterial toxins is only feasible with grab samples, which, with only sporadic sam-pling, results in uncertainties in the spatial distribution of toxins. To address this issue, we conducted two intensive HABs Grabs of microcystin (MC)-producing Microcystis blooms in the western basin of Lake Erie. These were one-day sampling events during August of 2018 and 2019 in which 100 and 172 grab samples were collected, respectively, within a six-hour window covering up to 2,270 km(2) and analyzed using consistent methods to estimate the total mass of MC. The samples were analyzed for 57 parameters, including toxins, nutrients, chlorophyll, and genomics. There were an estimated 11,513 kg and 30,691 kg of MCs in the western basin during the 2018 and 2019 HABs Grabs, respectively. The bloom boundary poses substantial issues for spatial assessments because MC concentration varied by nearly two orders of magnitude over very short distances. The MC to chlorophyll ratio (MC:chl) varied by a factor up to 5.3 throughout the basin, which creates challenges for using MC:chl to predict MC concentrations. Many of the biomass metrics strongly correlated (r > 0.70) with each other except chlorophyll fluorescence and phycocyanin concentration. While MC and chlorophyll correlated well with total phosphorus and nitrogen concentrations, MC:chl correlated with dissolved inorganic nitrogen. More frequent MC data collection can overcome these issues, and models need to account for the MC:chl spatial heterogeneity when forecasting MCs.","[Chaffin, Justin D.; Bair, Halli B.; Stanislawczyk, Keara] Ohio State Univ, FT Stone Lab & Ohio Sea Grant, 878 Bayview Ave POB 119, Put In Bay, OH 43456 USA; [Bratton, John F.; Verhamme, Edward M.] LimnoTech, 501 Avis Dr, Ann Arbor, MI 48108 USA; [Beecher, Amber A.; Bridgeman, Thomas B.; Swan, Zachary D.; Snyder, Brenda K.] Univ Toledo, Lake Erie Ctr, 6200 Bayshore Rd, Oregon, OH 43616 USA; [Binding, Caren E.; Zastepa, Arthur] Canada Ctr Inland Waters, Environm & Climate Change Canada, 867 Lakeshore Rd, Burlington, ON L7S 1A1, Canada; [Birbeck, Johnna A.; Westrick, Judy A.] Wayne State Univ, Lumigen Instrument Ctr, 5101Cass Ave, Detroit, MI 48202 USA; [Chang, Xuexiu; Drouillard, Kenneth G.; Frenken, Thijs; MacIsaac, Hugh J.; McKay, R.

However, understanding interactions between plastic and microbes in the Plastisphere-the thin layer of life on the surface of PMD-has been technology-limited. Research into microbe-microbe and microbe-substrate interactions requires knowledge of community phylogenetic composition but also tools to visualize spatial distributions of intact microbial biofilm communities. We developed a CLASI-FISH (combinatorial labelling and spectral imaging - fluorescence in situ hybridization) method using confocal microscopy to study Plastisphere communities. We created a probe set consisting of three existing phylogenetic probes (targeting all Bacteria, Alpha-, and Gammaproteobacteria) and four newly designed probes (targeting Bacteroidetes, Vibrionaceae, Rhodobacteraceae and Alteromonadaceae) labelled with a total of seven fluorophores and validated this probe set using pure cultures. Our nested probe set strategy increases confidence in taxonomic identification because targets are confirmed with two or more probes, reducing false positives. We simultaneously identified and visualized these taxa and their spatial distribution within the microbial biofilms on polyethylene samples in colonization time series experiments in coastal environments from three different biogeographical regions. Comparing the relative abundance of 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing data with cell-count abundance data retrieved from the microscope images of the same samples showed a good agreement in bacterial composition. Microbial communities were heterogeneous, with direct spatial relationships between bacteria, cyanobacteria and eukaryotes such as diatoms but also micro-metazoa. Our research provides a valuable resource to investigate biofilm development, succession and associations between specific microscopic taxa at micrometre scales.","[Schlundt, Cathleen; Welch, Jessica L.

Galectins are widely distributed and highly conserved lectins that have key regulatory effects on both innate and adaptive immune responses. In addition, galectins can bind to exogenous (non-self) carbohydrates on the surface of bacteria, enveloped viruses, parasites, and fungi, and function as recognition receptors and effector factors in innate immunity. Like most invertebrates, eastern oysters (Crassostrea virginica) and softshell clams (Mya arenaria) can effectively respond to most immune challenges through soluble and hemocyte-associated lectins. The protozoan parasite Perkinsus marinus, however, can infect eastern oysters and cause Dermo disease, which is highly detrimental to both natural and farmed oyster populations. The sympatric Perkinsus chesapeaki, initially isolated from infected M. arenaria clams, can also be present in oysters, and there is little evidence of pathogenicity in either clams or oysters. In this review, we discuss selected observations from our studies on the mechanisms of Perkinsus recognition that are mediated by galectin-carbohydrate interactions. We identified in the oyster two galectins that we designated CvGal1 and CvGal2, which strongly recognize P. marinus trophozoites. In the clam we also identified galectin sequences, and focused on one (that we named MaGal1) that also recognizes Perkinsus species. Here we describe the biochemical characterization of CvGal1, CvGal2, and MaGal1 with focus on the detailed study of the carbohydrate specificity, and the glycosylated moieties on the surfaces of the oyster hemocytes and the two Perkinsus species (P. marinus and P. chesapeaki). Our goal is to gain further understanding of the biochemical basis for the interactions that lead to recognition and opsonization of the Perkinsus trophozoites by the bivalve hemocytes. These basic studies on the biology of host-parasite interactions may contribute to the development of novel intervention strategies for parasitic diseases of biomedical interest.","[Vasta, Gerardo R.; Feng, Chiguang; Tasumi, Satoshi; Abernathy, Kelsey; Iqbal, Muddasar; Smith, Brina; Brown, Sean; Vista, Aren] Univ Maryland, Sch Med, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Inst Marine & Environm Technol, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA; [Bianchet, Mario A.; Ghosh, Anita] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurol, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Bianchet, Mario A.; Ghosh, Anita] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biophys & Biophys Chem, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Wilson, Iain B.

There remain considerable gaps in our knowledge of marine mammal bioenergetics, which hinder the application of bioenergetic studies to inform policy decisions. We conducted a priority-setting exercise to identify high-priority unanswered questions in marine mammal bioenergetics, with an emphasis on questions relevant to conservation and management. Electronic communication and a virtual workshop were used to solicit and collate potential research questions from the marine mammal bioenergetic community. From a final list of 39 questions, 11 were identified as 'key'questions because they received votes from at least 50% of survey participants. Key questions included those related to energy intake (prey landscapes, exposure to human activities) and expenditure (field metabolic rate, exposure to human activities, lactation, time-activity budgets), energy allocation priorities, metrics of body condition and relationships with survival and reproductive success and extrapolation of data from one species to another. Existing tools to address key questions include labelled water, animal-borne sensors, mark-resight data from long-term research programs, environmental DNA and unmanned vehicles. Further validation of existing approaches and development of new methodologies are needed to comprehensively address some key questions, particularly for cetaceans. The identification of these key questions can provide a guiding framework to set research priorities, which ultimately may yield more accurate information to inform policies and better conserve marine mammal populations.","[McHuron, Elizabeth A.] Univ Washington, Cooperat Inst Climate Ocean & Ecosyst Studies, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Adamczak, Stephanie; Costa, Daniel P.; Keen, Kelly A.; Villegas-Amtmann, Stella] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Ecol & Evolutionary Biol Dept, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Arnould, John P.

In this perspective we use examples from studies of coral reefs to illustrate ways in which metabolomics has been and can be applied to understand coastal ecosystems. Examples of new insights that can be provided by metabolomics include resolving metabolite exchange between plants, animals and their microbiota, identifying the relevant metabolite exchanges associated with the onset and maintenance of diverse, microbial mutualisms characterizing unknown molecules that act as cues in coral, reproduction, or defining the suites of compounds involved in coral-algal competition and microbialization of algal-dominated ecosystems. Here we outline sampling, analytical and informatic methods that marine biologists and ecologists can apply to understand the role of chemical processes in ecosystems, with a focus on open access data analysis workflows and democratized databases. Finally, we demonstrate how these metabolomics tools and bioinformatics approaches can provide scientists the opportunity to map detailed metabolic inventories and dynamics for a holistic view of the relationships among reef organisms, their symbionts and their surrounding marine environment.","[Kelly, Linda Wegley; Aluwihare, Lihini I. .; Koester, Irina; Petras, Daniel; Quinlan, Zachary A.] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Kelly, Linda Wegley; Quinlan, Zachary A.] San Diego State Univ, Dept Biol, San Diego, CA 92182 USA; [Nelson, Craig E.; Matsuda, Shayle B.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Daniel K Inouye Ctr Microbial Oceanog Res & Educ, Sch Ocean & Earth Sci & Technol, Dept Oceanog, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Nelson, Craig E.; Matsuda, Shayle B.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Daniel K Inouye Ctr Microbial Oceanog Res & Educ, Sch Ocean & Earth Sci & Technol, Sea Grant Coll Program, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Arts, Milou G.

Following the fate of a known master sex-determining gene, we traced the evolution of sex determination in an entire teleost order (Esociformes). We discovered that the northern pike (Esox lucius) master sex-determining gene originated from a 65 to 90 million-year-old gene duplication event and that it remained sex linked on undifferentiated sex chromosomes for at least 56 million years in multiple species. We identified several independent species- or population-specific sex determination transitions, including a recent loss of a Y chromosome. These findings highlight the diversity of evolutionary fates of master sex-determining genes and the importance of population demographic history in sex determination studies. We hypothesize that occasional sex reversals and genetic bottlenecks provide a non-adaptive explanation for sex determination transitions.","[Pan, Qiaowei; Feron, Romain; Jouanno, Elodie; Herpin, Amaury; Guiguen, Yann] INRAE, LPGP, Rennes, France; [Pan, Qiaowei; Feron, Romain; Darras, Hugo] Univ Lausanne, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Lausanne, Switzerland; [Feron, Romain] Swiss Inst Bioinformat, Lausanne, Switzerland; [Koop, Ben; Rondeau, Eric] Univ Victoria, Ctr Biomed Res, Dept Biol, Victoria, BC, Canada; [Goetz, Frederick W.] NOAA, Environm & Fisheries Sci Div, Northwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Seattle, WA USA; [Larson, Wesley A.] Alaska Pacific Univ, Fisheries Aquat Sci & Technol Lab, Anchorage, AK USA; [Bernatchez, Louis] Univ Laval, Inst Biol Integrat & Syst IBIS, Quebec City, PQ, Canada; [Tringali, Mike] Florida Marine Res Inst, Fish & Wildlife Conservat Commiss, St Petersburg, FL USA; [Curran, Stephen S.] Auburn Univ, Sch Fisheries & Aquat Sci, Auburn, AL USA; [Saillant, Eric] Univ Southern Mississippi, Gulf Coast Res Lab, Sch Ocean Sci & Technol, Ocean Springs, MS USA; [Denys, Gael P.

Coastal zones in highly urbanized or industrial areas are particularly vulnerable to PFOS pollution. At present, information is lacking on biomarkers to assess PFOS effects on aquatic wildlife. This study investigated the efficacy of L-carnitine (or carnitine) and fatty acids as biomarkers of PFOS exposure in aquatic biota. The levels of PFOS, total and free carnitine, and 24 fatty acids (measured as fatty acid methyl esters or FAMEs) were measured in the liver, and muscle or blubber, of fish and dolphins sampled from Galveston Bay and the northern Gulf of Mexico (nGoM). Overall, bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) had the highest hepatic PFOS levels. Galveston Bay fish, gafftopsail catfish (Bagre marinus), red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus), and spotted seatrout (Cynoscion nebulosus), had hepatic PFOS levels -8-13x higher than nGoM pelagic fish species, red snapper (Lutjanus campechanus) and yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares). The multivariate analysis of PFOS liver bodyburdens and biomarkers found carnitine to be a more modal biomarker of PFOS exposure than FAMEs. Significant positive correlation of hepatic PFOS levels with total carnitine was evident for biota from Galveston Bay (fish only), and a significant correlation between PFOS and total and free carnitine was evident for biota from the nGoM (fish and dolphins). Given the essential role of carnitine in mediating fatty acid beta-oxidation, our results suggest carnitine to be a likely candidate biomarker of environmental PFOS exposure and indicative of potential dyslipidemia effects.","[Nolen, Rayna M.; Prouse, Alexandra; Petersen, Lene H.; Hala, David; Quigg, Antonietta] Texas A&M Univ Galveston, Dept Marine Biol, 200 Seawolf Pkwy, Galveston, TX 77553 USA; [Russell, Mackenzie L.; Bloodgood, Jennifer; Clark, Cristina Diaz; Carmichael, Ruth H.] Univ Programs, Dauphin Isl Sea Lab, 101 Bienville Blvd, Dauphin Isl, AL 36528 USA; [Bloodgood, Jennifer; Carmichael, Ruth H.] Univ S Alabama, Stokes Sch Marine & Environm Sci, 307 N Univ Blvd, Mobile, AL 36688 USA; [Bloodgood, Jennifer] Cornell Univ, Cornell Wildlife Hlth Lab, Coll Vet Med, 240 Farrier Rd, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Kaiser, Karl] Texas A&M Univ Galveston, Dept Marine & Coastal Environm Sci, 200 Seawolf Pkwy, Galveston, TX 77553 USA; [Kaiser, Karl; Quigg, Antonietta] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Oceanog, 3146 TAMU, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Quigg, Antonietta] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Ecol & Conservat Biol, 3146 TAMU, College Stn, TX 77843 USA","Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; Dauphin Island Sea Lab; University of South Alabama; Cornell University; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station","Nolen, RM (corresponding author), Texas A&M Univ Galveston, Dept Marine Biol, 200 Seawolf Pkwy, Galveston, TX 77553 USA.","nolen.rayna@gmail.com","","Prouse, Alexandra/0000-0002-3368-6016; Carmichael, Ruth/0000-0002-6033-3777","Galveston Bay Estuary Program [582-22-30197]; National Science Foundation [HDBE-1936174]; Research and Development program of the Texas General Land Office Oil Spill Prevention and Response Division [20-057-000-B908]; National Sea Grant Office, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce [NA18OAR4170088]; National Fish and Wildlife Foundation (NFWF) [45720]; Alabama Trustee Implementation Group","Galveston Bay Estuary Program; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Research and Development program of the Texas General Land Office Oil Spill Prevention and Response Division; National Sea Grant Office, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); National Fish and Wildlife Foundation (NFWF); Alabama Trustee Implementation Group","This work was supported by funds, in-part or whole, from the Galveston Bay Estuary Program Grant No. 582-22-30197 to Hala, National Science Foundation Rapid Response Research Grant No. HDBE-1936174 to Hala; Research and Development program of the Texas General Land Office Oil Spill Prevention and Response Division under Grant No. 20-057-000-B908 to Quigg; and an Institutional Grant NA18OAR4170088, to the Texas Sea Grant College Program from the National Sea Grant Office, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce to Nolen.

The bay is a popular recreation location and a regional source for drinking water. Like the western basin of Lake Erie, Sandusky Bay is known for being host to summer cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (cHABs) year after year, fueled by runoff from the predominantly agricultural watershed and internal loading of legacy nutrients (primarily phosphorus). Since at least 2003, Sandusky Bay has harbored a microcystin-producing bloom of Planktothrix agardhii, a species of filamentous cyanobacteria that thrives in low light conditions. Long-term sampling (2003-2018) of Sandusky Bay revealed regular Planktothrix-dominated blooms during the summer months, but in recent years (2019-2022), 16S rRNA gene community profiling revealed that Planktothrix has largely disappeared. From 2017-2022, microcystin decreased well below the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines. Spring TN:TP ratios increased in years following dam removal, yet there were no statistically significant shifts in other physicochemical variables, such as water temperature and water clarity. With the exception of the high bloom of Planktothrix in 2018, there was no statistical difference in chlorophyll during all other years. Concurrent with the disappearance of Planktothrix, Cyanobium spp. have become the dominant cyanobacterial group. The appearance of other potential toxigenic genera (i.e., Aphanizomenon, Dolichospermum, Cylindrospermopsis) may motivate monitoring of new toxins of concern in Sandusky Bay. Here, we document the regime shift in the cyanobacterial community and propose evidence supporting the hypothesis that the decline in the Planktothrix bloom was linked to the removal of an upstream dam on the Sandusky River.","[Neudeck, Michelle J.; Heath, Alexis E.; Barker, Katelyn B.; Brown, Katelyn M.; Buchholz, Seth; Ward, Christopher S.] Bowling Green State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Life Sci Bldg, Bowling Green, OH 43403 USA; [Neudeck, Michelle J.; Heath, Alexis E.; Barker, Katelyn B.; Brown, Katelyn M.; Buchholz, Seth; Ward, Christopher S.] Bowling Green State Univ, Great Lakes Ctr Fresh Waters & Human Hlth, Dept Biol Sci, Bowling Green, OH 43043 USA; [Neudeck, Michelle J.; Heath, Alexis E.; Barker, Katelyn B.; Brown, Katelyn M.; Buchholz, Seth; Ward, Christopher S.] Bowling Green State Univ, Ctr Great Lakes & Watershed Studies, Dept Biol Sci, Bowling Green, OH 43043 USA","University System of Ohio; Bowling Green State University; University System of Ohio; Bowling Green State University; University System of Ohio; Bowling Green State University","Ward, CS (corresponding author), Bowling Green State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Life Sci Bldg, Bowling Green, OH 43403 USA.;Ward, CS (corresponding author), Bowling Green State Univ, Great Lakes Ctr Fresh Waters & Human Hlth, Dept Biol Sci, Bowling Green, OH 43043 USA.;Ward, CS (corresponding author), Bowling Green State Univ, Ctr Great Lakes & Watershed Studies, Dept Biol Sci, Bowling Green, OH 43043 USA.","chrward@bgsu.edu","","Wagner, Ryan/0000-0002-5197-4230; Brown, Katelyn/0000-0002-8581-9490","National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce through the Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Office of Coastal Management [NA20NOS4190084]; NIH/NSF Great Lakes Center for Fresh Waters and Human Health at Bowling Green State University [1P01ES028939-01, 1840715]","National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce through the Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Office of Coastal Management(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); NIH/NSF Great Lakes Center for Fresh Waters and Human Health at Bowling Green State University(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA)","This article was prepared in part using Federal funds under award NA20NOS4190084 from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce through the Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Office of Coastal Management.

However, this hypothesis of a conserved master sex-determining role of sdY in salmonids is challenged by a few exceptions, one of them being the presence of naturally occurring apparent XY Chinook salmon, Oncorhynchus tshawytscha, females. Here, we show that some XY Chinook salmon females have a sdY gene (sdY-N183), with 1 missense mutation leading to a substitution of a conserved isoleucine to an asparagine (I183N). In contrast, Chinook salmon males have both a nonmutated sdY-I183 gene and the missense mutation sdY-N183 gene. The 3-dimensional model of SdY-I183N predicts that the I183N hydrophobic to hydrophilic amino acid change leads to a modification in the SdY beta-sandwich structure. Using in vitro cell transfection assays, we found that SdY-I183N, like the wild-type SdY, is preferentially localized in the cytoplasm. However, compared to wild-type SdY, SdY-I183N is more prone to degradation, its nuclear translocation by Foxl2 is reduced, and SdY-I183N is unable to significantly repress the synergistic Foxl2/Nr5a1 induction of the cyp19a1a promoter. Altogether, our results suggest that the sdY-N183 gene of XY Chinook females is nonfunctional and that SdY-I183N is no longer able to promote testicular differentiation by impairing the synthesis of estrogens in the early differentiating gonads of wild Chinook salmon XY females.","[Bertho, Sylvain; Herpin, Amaury; Jouanno, Elodie; Yano, Ayaka; Bobe, Julien; Guiguen, Yann] INRAE, LPGP, F-35000 Rennes, France; [Bertho, Sylvain] Univ Wurzburg, Bioctr, Physiol Chem, D-97074 Wurzburg, Germany; [Parrinello, Hugues; Journot, Laurent] Univ Montpellier, Inst Genom Fonct, INSERM, CNRS,IGF, F-34094 Montpellier, France; [Guyomard, Rene] Univ Paris Saclay, AgroParisTech, INRAE, GABI, F-75005 Paris, France; [Muller, Thomas] Univ Wurzburg, Julius von Sachs Inst, Dept Mol Plant Physiol & Biophys, D-97082 Wurzburg, Germany; [Swanson, Penny] NOAA, Environm & Fisheries Sci Div, Northwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Seattle, WA 98112 USA; [McKinney, Garrett] Washington Dept Fish & Wildlife, Mol Genet Lab, Olympia, WA 98501 USA; [Williamson, Kevin] Atreca Inc, San Carlos, CA 94070 USA; [Meek, Mariah] Michigan State Univ, Dept Integrat Biol, AgBio Res, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Meek, Mariah] Michigan State Univ, Ecol Evolut & Behav Program, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Schartl, Manfred] Texas State Univ, Xiphophorus Genet Stock Ctr, Dept Chem & Biochem, San Marcos, TX 78666 USA; [Schartl, Manfred] Univ Wurzburg, Bioctr, Dept Dev Biochem, D-97074 Wurzburg, Germany","INRAE; University of Wurzburg; Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm); Universite de Montpellier; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite Paris Saclay; INRAE; Universite Paris Cite; AgroParisTech; University of Wurzburg; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Washington Department of Fish & Wildlife (WDFW); Michigan State University; Michigan State University AgBioResearch; Michigan State University; Texas State University System; Texas State University San Marcos; University of Wurzburg","Schartl, M (corresponding author), Univ Wurzburg, Bioctr, Dept Dev Biochem, D-97074 Wurzburg, Germany.;Guiguen, Y (corresponding author), INRAE, UR1037, LPGP, Fish Physiol & Genom, Campus Beaulieu, F-35042 Rennes, France.","phch1@biozentrum.uni-wuerzburg.de; yann.guiguen@inrae.fr","Mller, Timo/AAZ-4445-2020; Bobe, Julien/I-6851-2017; Journot, Laurent/T-9652-2018; Herpin, Amaury/B-8950-2011","Bertho, Sylvain/0000-0002-1219-7352; Bobe, Julien/0000-0002-9355-8227; Parrinello, Hugues/0000-0002-1151-001X; Journot, Laurent/0000-0003-3499-8887; Herpin, Amaury/0000-0002-0630-4027; Mueller, Thomas/0000-0003-1862-7357","Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR) [ANR ANR-11-BSV7-0016]; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [Scha408/12-1, 10-1]; Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR) [ANR-11-BSV7-0016] Funding Source: Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)","Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR))","This work was supported by Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR) grant ANR ANR-11-BSV7-0016 (SDS project) and grants to MS by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (Scha408/12-1, 10-1).",NA,36,2,2,0,9,"OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC","CARY","JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA","2160-1836","","","G3-GENES GENOM GENET","G3-Genes Genomes Genet.","FEB 4",2022,12,"2",NA,"","","",NA,NA,"jkab451","10.1093/g3journal/jkab451","http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/g3journal/jkab451",NA,"JAN 2022",10,"Genetics & Heredity","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Genetics & Heredity","ZS1PD",35100376,"Green Published, gold, Green Submitted","","","2024-10-25","WOS:000768242900029","View Full Record in Web of Science",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Here, we investigate whether similar patterns of neurological impacts are observed in a temperate Pacific fish that naturally experiences regular and often large shifts in environmental pH/pCO(2). In two laboratory experiments, we tested the effect of acidification, as well as pH/pCO(2) variability, on gene expression in the brain tissue of a common temperate kelp forest/estuarine fish, Embiotoca jacksoni. Experiment 1 employed static pH treatments (target pH = 7.85/7.30), while Experiment 2 incorporated two variable treatments that oscillated around corresponding static treatments with the same mean (target pH = 7.85/7.70) in an eight-day cycle (amplitude +/- 0.15). We found that patterns of global gene expression differed across pH level treatments. Additionally, we identified differential expression of specific genes and enrichment of specific gene sets (GSEA) in comparisons of static pH treatments and in comparisons of static and variable pH treatments of the same mean pH. Importantly, we found that pH/pCO(2) variability decreased the number of differentially expressed genes detected between high and low pH treatments, and that interindividual variability in gene expression was greater in variable treatments than static treatments. These results provide important confirmation of neurological impacts of acidification in a temperate fish species and, critically, that natural environmental variability may mediate the impacts of ocean acidification.","[Toy, Jason A.; Kroeker, Kristy J.; Longo, Gary C.; Bernardi, Giacomo] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Logan, Cheryl A.] Calif State Univ Monterey Bay, Div Sci & Environm Policy, Seaside, CA USA; [Takeshita, Yuichiro] Monterey Bay Aquarium Res Inst, Moss Landing, CA USA; [Longo, Gary C.] Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, NRC Res Associateship Program, Northwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, NOAA, Seattle, WA USA","University of California System; University of California Santa Cruz; California State University System; California State University Monterey Bay; Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA","Toy, JA (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.","jatoy@ucsc.edu","Takeshita, Yuichiro/HNP-5848-2023; Bernardi, Giacomo/F-6346-2011; Logan, Cheryl/AAU-3609-2021; Toy, Jason/HIK-3066-2022","Toy, Jason/0000-0002-2126-7826; Takeshita, Yuichiro/0000-0003-1824-8517; Logan, Cheryl/0000-0001-7639-4956; Kroeker, Kristy/0000-0002-5766-1999; Longo, Gary/0000-0002-4282-9111","David and Lucile Packard Foundation; Packard Endowment Award via UCSC; UCSC Committee on Research","David and Lucile Packard Foundation(The David & Lucile Packard Foundation); Packard Endowment Award via UCSC; UCSC Committee on Research","David and Lucile Packard Foundation; Packard Endowment Award via UCSC; UCSC Committee on Research; the David and Lucile Packard Foundation",NA,79,3,4,2,18,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","0962-1083","1365-294X","","MOL ECOL","Mol.

Several pleiotropic hormones, including prolactin, growth hormone, and thyroid hormones (THs) are mediators of salinity acclimation. It is unclear, however, the extent to which THs and the pituitary-thyroid axis promote the adaptive responses of key osmoregulatory organs to freshwater (FW) environments. In the current study, we characterized circulating thyroxine (T4) and 3-3'-5-triiodothyronine (T3) levels in parallel with the outer ring deiodination (ORD) activities of deiodinases (dios) and mRNA expression of dio1, dio2, and dio3 in gill during the acclimation of Mozambique tilapia (Oreochromis mossambicus) to FW. Tilapia transferred from seawater (SW) to FW exhibited reduced plasma T4 and T3 levels at 6 h. These reductions coincided with an increase in branchial dio2-like activity and decreased branchial dio1 gene expression. To assess whether dios respond to osmotic conditions and/or systemic signals, gill filaments were exposed to osmolalities ranging from 280 to 450 mOsm/ kg in an in vitro incubation system. Gene expression of branchial dio1, dio2, and dio3 was not directly affected by extracellular osmotic conditions. Lastly, we observed that dio1 and dio2 expression was stimulated by thyroidstimulating hormone in hypophysectomized tilapia, suggesting that branchial TH metabolism is regulated by systemic signals. Our collective findings suggest that THs are involved in the FW acclimation of Mozambique tilapia through their interactions with branchial deiodinases that modulate their activities in a key osmoregulatory organ.","[Seale, Lucia A.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Pacific Biosci Res Ctr, Sch Ocean & Earth Sci & Technol, 1933 East West Rd, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Gilman, Christy L.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, John A Burns Sch Med, Dept Cell & Mol Biol, 651 Ilalo St, Honolulu, HI 96813 USA; [Zavacki, Ann Marie; Larsen, P.

In order to maintain their body fluids near osmotic set points in the face of salinity changes, euryhaline fishes rely upon tissue-level osmotically-induced responses and systemic endocrine signaling to direct adaptive iontransport processes in the gill and other critical osmoregulatory organs. Some euryhaline teleosts inhabit tidally influenced waters such as estuaries where salinity can vary between fresh water (FW) and seawater (SW). The physiological adaptations that underlie euryhalinity in teleosts have been traditionally identified in fish held under steady-state conditions or following unidirectional transfers between FW and SW. Far fewer studies have employed salinity regimes that simulate the tidal cycles that some euryhaline fishes may experience in their native habitats. With an emphasis on prolactin (Prl) signaling and branchial ionocytes, this mini-review contrasts the physiological responses between euryhaline fish responding to tidal versus unidirectional changes in salinity. Three patterns that emerged from studying Mozambique tilapia (Oreochromis mossambicus) subjected to tidallychanging salinities include, 1) fish can compensate for continuous and marked changes in external salinity to maintain osmoregulatory parameters within narrow ranges, 2) tilapia maintain branchial ionocyte populations in a fashion similar to SW-acclimated fish, and 3) there is a shift from systemic to local modulation of Prl signaling.","[Seale, Andre P.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Human Nutr Food & Anim Sci, 1955 East West Rd, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Breves, Jason P.] Skidmore Coll, Dept Biol, 815 N Broadway, Saratoga Springs, NY 12866 USA","University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; Skidmore College","Seale, AP (corresponding author), Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Human Nutr Food & Anim Sci, 1955 East West Rd, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.","seale@hawaii.edu","","","National Science Foundation [IOS-1755016, IOS-1755131]; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration [NA18OAR4170347]; National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases [R21DK111775]; National Institute of Food and Agriculture [HAW02051-H]","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Diabetes & Digestive & Kidney Diseases (NIDDK)); National Institute of Food and Agriculture(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)National Institute of Food and Agriculture)","We are grateful to Prof. E.

Species of the Phylum Chaetognatha (arrow worms) are abundant in the zooplankton assemblage and are highly effective predators, with key roles in pelagic food webs. They are useful indicator species for impacts of climate change on marine ecosystems. This study examined the population genetic diversity, structure and connectivity of the chaetognath, Eukrohnia hamata, based on sampling from six regions defined by geography, bathymetry, and major currents flowing through the Arctic Ocean. A 528-base pair sequenced region of mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (mtCOI) analyzed for 131 specimens resulted in 78 haplotypes and very high haplotype diversity. Analysis of mtCOI haplotype frequencies provided no evidence of population genetic structure. Genomic Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) detected from the same specimens by doubledigest Restriction-site Associated Digestion (ddRAD) confirmed high levels of gene flow among the regions, but supported the genetic distinctiveness of two population clusters: Atlantic-Arctic versus Pacific-Arctic. Removal of SNPs subject to selection resulted in slightly higher probability of three clusters, and suggested the possibility of local adaptation of regional populations of E. hamata. Comparative analysis revealed evidence that random selection of subsets of SNPs, perhaps impacted by different ecological and (micro) evolutionary drivers, can result in marked differences in numbers and distributional patterns of clusters and associated variation in F-statistics. Analysis of population connectivity using SNPs supported the primary migration pathway via flow from the Atlantic to the Pacific Arctic regions.","[DeHart, Hayley M.; Bucklin, Ann] Univ Connecticut, Dept Marine Sci, Groton, CT 06340 USA; [Blanco-Bercial, Leocadio] Bermuda Inst Ocean Sci, St Georges, Bermuda; [Passacantando, Mollie] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Marine & Coastal Sci, New Brunswick, NJ USA; [Questel, Jennifer M.] Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Inst Marine Sci, Fairbanks, AK USA","University of Connecticut; Bermuda Institute of Ocean Sciences; Rutgers University System; Rutgers University New Brunswick; University of Alaska System; University of Alaska Fairbanks","Bucklin, A (corresponding author), Univ Connecticut, Dept Marine Sci, Groton, CT 06340 USA.","ann.bucklin@uconn.edu","Blanco-Bercial, Leocadio/N-4061-2019; Questel, Jennifer/HKW-8698-2023; Blanco-Bercial, Leocadio/G-5441-2013","Bucklin, Ann/0000-0003-3750-9348; Blanco-Bercial, Leocadio/0000-0003-0658-7183","Chukchi Sea Environmental Studies Program (ConocoPhillips); Chukchi Sea Environmental Studies Program (Shell Exploration and Production); Chukchi Sea Environmental Studies Program (Statoil USA); United States-Canadian Transboundary Fish and Lower Trophic Communities Project (Bureau of Ocean Energy Management); SI_Arctic Initiative (Institute of Marine Research, Tromso, Norway); EuroBASIN Program (Institute of Marine Research, Bergen, Norway); NOAA Office of Exploration and Research (Chukchi Borderland Project) [NA15OAR0110209]; NSF Research Experiences for Undergraduate (REU) Program at Mystic Aquarium [1658663, 1658742]; University of Connecticut [1658663, 1658742]; Div Of Biological Infrastructure; Direct For Biological Sciences [1658663, 1658742] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Chukchi Sea Environmental Studies Program (ConocoPhillips); Chukchi Sea Environmental Studies Program (Shell Exploration and Production); Chukchi Sea Environmental Studies Program (Statoil USA); United States-Canadian Transboundary Fish and Lower Trophic Communities Project (Bureau of Ocean Energy Management); SI_Arctic Initiative (Institute of Marine Research, Tromso, Norway); EuroBASIN Program (Institute of Marine Research, Bergen, Norway); NOAA Office of Exploration and Research (Chukchi Borderland Project); NSF Research Experiences for Undergraduate (REU) Program at Mystic Aquarium; University of Connecticut; Div Of Biological Infrastructure; Direct For Biological Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO))","Zooplankton samples analyzed for this study were collected during Arctic cruises sponsored and funded through various programs, including: Chukchi Sea Environmental Studies Program (funded by ConocoPhillips, Shell Exploration and Production, and Statoil USA); United States-Canadian Transboundary Fish and Lower Trophic Communities Project (Bureau of Ocean Energy Management); SI_Arctic Initiative (Institute of Marine Research, Tromso, Norway); and the EuroBASIN Program (Institute of Marine Research, Bergen, Norway).

These communities feature an unusually high abundance of brain corals, which have almost entirely vanished from nearby offshore reefs. These corals appear to be thriving in very low-quality waters influenced by dense ship and boat traffic, dredging, and numerous residential and industrial developments. The PoM basin is part of Biscayne Bay, an estuarine environment that experiences frequent freshwater input, high nutrient loading, hypoxia, and acidification. To investigate if there is a molecular basis behind the ability of these corals to persist within these highly urbanized waters, we compared whole transcriptome expression profiles from 25 PoM Pseudodiploria strigosa colonies against six conspecifics from a nearby offshore reef. We found that the urban corals exhibited higher expression of (1) transcripts encoding pattern-recognition receptors which may allow these corals to better sense and detect food particles and pathogenic invaders; (2) digestive and degradation-associated enzymes, which may suggest an elevated capacity for heterotrophy and pathogen digestion; and (3) transcripts related to innate immunity, defense, and cellular detoxification, which may collectively protect against pathogenic organisms and water pollution impacts. Large ribosomal subunit rRNA gene mapping revealed that P. strigosa colonies from the PoM sites predominantly hosted heat-tolerant endosymbionts from the genus Durusdinium while offshore conspecifics' communities were dominated by symbionts in the genus Breviolum. These findings reveal transcriptomic plasticity and molecular mechanisms contributing to the persistence of these corals within a highly urbanized habitat.","[Rubin, Ewelina T.; Mayfield, Anderson B.; Kolodziej, Graham; Basden, Isabelle] Univ Miami, Cooperat Inst Marine & Atmospher Studies, Miami, FL 33146 USA; [Enochs, Ian C.] Natl Oceanog & Atmospher Adm NOAA, Ocean Chem & Ecosyst Div, Atlant Oceanog & Meteorol Lab, Miami, FL USA; [Foord, Colin] Coral Morphol, Miami, FL USA; [Manzello, Derek P.] Natl Oceanog & Atmospher Adm NOAA, Satellite Oceanog & Climate Div, Ctr Satellite Applicat & Res, College Pk, MD USA","University of Miami; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Atlantic Oceanographic & Meteorological Laboratory (AOML)","Rubin, ET (corresponding author), Univ Miami, Cooperat Inst Marine & Atmospher Studies, Miami, FL 33146 USA.","ewelina.rubin@noaa.gov","Manzello, Derek/A-8661-2014; Enochs, Ian/B-8051-2014; Kolodziej, Graham/A-3034-2017","Mayfield, Anderson/0000-0003-0138-7844","","","",NA,94,13,15,6,20,"FRONTIERS MEDIA SA","LAUSANNE","AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND","","2296-7745","","FRONT MAR SCI","Front.

Based on three new chromosome-scale assemblies in Perca fluviatilis, Perca schrenkii, and Sander vitreus along with additional percid fish reference genomes, we provide an evolutionary and comparative genomic analysis of their sex-determination systems. ResultsWe explored the fate of a duplicated anti-Mullerian hormone receptor type-2 gene (amhr2bY), previously suggested to be the master sex-determining (MSD) gene in P. flavescens. Phylogenetically related and structurally similar amhr2 duplicates (amhr2b) were found in P. schrenkii and Sander lucioperca, potentially dating this duplication event to their last common ancestor around 19-27 Mya. In P. fluviatilis and S. vitreus, this amhr2b duplicate has been likely lost while it was subject to amplification in S. lucioperca. Analyses of the amhr2b locus in P. schrenkii suggest that this duplication could be also male-specific as it is in P. flavescens. In P. fluviatilis, a relatively small (100 kb) non-recombinant sex-determining region (SDR) was characterized on chromosome 18 using population-genomics approaches. This SDR is characterized by many male-specific single-nucleotide variations (SNVs) and no large duplication/insertion event, suggesting that P. fluviatilis has a male heterogametic sex-determination system (XX/XY), generated by allelic diversification. This SDR contains six annotated genes, including three (c18h1orf198, hsdl1, tbc1d32) with higher expression in the testis than in the ovary. ConclusionsTogether, our results provide a new example of the highly dynamic sex chromosome turnover in teleosts and provide new genomic resources for Percidae, including sex-genotyping tools for all three known Perca species.","[Kuhl, Heiner; Kloas, Werner; Wuertz, Sven; Stoeck, Matthias] IGB Forsch verbund Berlin, Leibniz Inst Freshwater Ecol & Inland Fisheries, Muggelseedamm 301, D-12587 Berlin, Germany; [Euclide, Peter T.] Purdue Univ, Illinois Indiana Sea Grant, Dept Forestry & Nat Resources, W Lafayette, IN USA; [Klopp, Christophe; Zahm, Margot] INRAE, Biometrie & Intelligence Artificielle UR875, Sigenae, Plateforme Bioinformat,Genotoul,Bioinf, Castanet Tolosan, France; [Cabau, Cedric] Univ Toulouse, Sigenae, GenPhySE, INRAE, Castanet Tolosan, France; [Lopez-Roques, Celine; Iampietro, Carole; Kuchly, Claire; Donnadieu, Cecile] INRAE, US 1426, GeT PlaGe, Genotoul, Castanet Tolosan, France; [Feron, Romain] Univ Lausanne, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Lausanne, Switzerland; [Feron, Romain] Swiss Inst Bioinformat, Lausanne, Switzerland; [Parrinello, Hugues] Montpellier GenomiX MGX, Inst Genom Fonct, 141 Rue Cardonille, F-34094 Montpellier 05, France; [Poncet, Charles; Jaffrelo, Lydia; Confolent, Carole] Univ Clermont Auvergne, GDEC Gentyane, INRAE, Clermont Ferrand, France; [Wen, Ming; Herpin, Amaury; Jouanno, Elodie; Guiguen, Yann] INRAE, LPGP, F-35000 Rennes, France; [Wen, Ming] Hunan Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci, State Key Lab Dev Biol Freshwater Fish, Changsha, Peoples R China; [Bestin, Anastasia; Haffray, Pierrick; Morvezen, Romain] Stn INRAE, SYSAAF, LPGP, Campus Beaulieu, F-35042 Rennes, France; [de Almeida, Taina Rocha; Lecocq, Thomas; Schaerlinger, Berenice; Chardard, Dominique] Univ Lorraine, INRAE, L2A, Nancy, France; [Zarski, Daniel] Polish Acad Sci, Inst Anim Reprod & Food Res, Dept Gamete & Embryo Biol, Ul Tuwima 10, PL-10748 Olsztyn, Poland; [Larson, Wesley A.] Natl Oceanog & Atmospher Adm, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Alaska Fisheries Sci Ctr, 17109 Point Lena Loop Rd,Auke Bay Lab, Juneau, AK 99801 USA; [Postlethwait, John H.] Univ Oregon, Inst Neurosci, Eugene, OR 97403 USA; [Timirkhanov, Serik] Sea Biol LLP, Alma Ata, Kazakhstan","Leibniz Institut fur Gewasserokologie und Binnenfischerei (IGB); Purdue University System; Purdue University; INRAE; INRAE; INRAE; University of Lausanne; Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics; Universite Clermont Auvergne (UCA); INRAE; INRAE; Hunan Normal University; INRAE; INRAE; Universite de Lorraine; Polish Academy of Sciences; Institute of Animal Reproduction & Food Research of the Polish Academy of Sciences; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of Oregon","Kuhl, H (corresponding author), IGB Forsch verbund Berlin, Leibniz Inst Freshwater Ecol & Inland Fisheries, Muggelseedamm 301, D-12587 Berlin, Germany.;Guiguen, Y (corresponding author), INRAE, LPGP, F-35000 Rennes, France.","Heiner.Kuhl@igb-berlin.de; yann.guiguen@inrae.fr","Klopp, Christophe/J-3164-2019; _arski, Daniel/H-9091-2019; Kuhl, Heiner/L-2737-2019; Feron, Romain/AAG-8581-2020","Euclide, Peter/0000-0002-1212-0435; Iampietro, Carole/0000-0002-8148-4785; LOPEZ-ROQUES, Celine/0000-0003-2529-7958; Kuhl, Heiner/0000-0001-7623-9227; Christophe, KLOPP/0000-0001-7126-5477; Zahm, Margot/0000-0001-8632-0109; kuchly, claire/0000-0001-8994-550X","Projekt DEAL; German Research Foundation (DFG) Eigene Stelle [KU 3596/1-1, 324050651]; Agence Nationale pour la Recherche (ANR)/DFG PhyloSex project [ANR-13-ISV7-0005]; CRB-Anim Centre de Ressources Biologiques pour les animaux domestiques project PERCH'SEX; FEAMP Fonds europeen pour les affaires maritimes et la peche project SEX'NPERCH,; NIH [R35 GM139635]; NSF [2232891]; France Genomique National infrastructure as part of the Investissement d'avenir program [ANR-10-INBS-09]; Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR) [ANR-13-ISV7-0005] Funding Source: Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)","Projekt DEAL; German Research Foundation (DFG) Eigene Stelle(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Agence Nationale pour la Recherche (ANR)/DFG PhyloSex project(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)); CRB-Anim Centre de Ressources Biologiques pour les animaux domestiques project PERCH'SEX; FEAMP Fonds europeen pour les affaires maritimes et la peche project SEX'NPERCH,; NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); France Genomique National infrastructure as part of the Investissement d'avenir program(General Electric); Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR))","Open Access funding enabled and organized by Projekt DEAL.

In the euryhaline and eurythermal Mozambique tilapia, Oreochromis mossambicus, Prl cells are model osmoreceptors, recently described to be thermosensitive. To investigate the effects of temperature on osmoreception, we incubated Prl cells of tilapia acclimated to either FW or seawater (SW) in different combinations of temperatures (20, 26 and 32 degrees C) and osmolalities (280, 330 and 420 mOsm/kg) for 6 h. Release of both Prl isoforms, Prl(188) and Prl(177), increased in hyposmotic media and were further augmented with a rise in temperature. Hyposmotically-induced release of Prl(188), but not Prl(177), was suppressed at 20 degrees C. In SW fish, mRNA expression of prl(188) increased with rising temperatures at lower osmolalities, while and prl(177) decreased at 32 degrees C and higher osmolalities. In Prl cells of SW-acclimated tilapia incubated in hyperosmotic media, the expressions of Prl receptors, prlr1 and prlr2, and the stretch-activated Ca2+ channel, trpv4,decreased at 32 degrees C, suggesting the presence of a cellular mechanism to compensate for elevated Prl release. Transcription factors, pou1f1, pou2f1b, creb3l1, cebpb, stat3, stat1a and nfat1c, known to regulate prl(188) and prl(177), were also downregulated at 32 degrees C.

The taxa are sister clades whose members consume wood as food with the aid of intracellular cellulolytic endosymbionts housed in their gills. This combination of adaptations is found in no other group of animals and was likely present in the common ancestor of both families. Despite these commonalities, the two families have followed dramatically different evolutionary paths with respect to anatomy, life history, and distribution. Here, we present 42 new mitochondrial genome sequences from Teredinidae and Xylophagaidae and show that distinct trajectories have also occurred in the evolution and organization of their mitochondrial genomes. Teredinidae display significantly greater rates of amino acid substitution but absolute conservation of protein-coding gene order, whereas Xylophagaidae display significantly less amino acid change but have undergone numerous and diverse changes in genome organization since their divergence from a common ancestor. As with many bivalves, these mitochondrial genomes encode 2 ribosomal RNAs, 12 protein-coding genes, and 22 tRNAs; atp8 was not detected. We further show that their phylogeny, as inferred from amino acid sequences of 12 concatenated mitochondrial protein-coding genes, is largely congruent with those inferred from their nuclear genomes based on 18S and 28S ribosomal RNA sequences. Our results provide a robust phylogenetic framework to explore the tempo and mode of mitochondrial genome evolution and offer directions for future phylogenetic and taxonomic studies of wood-boring bivalves.","[Li, Yuanning] Shandong Univ, Inst Marine Sci & Technol, Qingdao 266237, Peoples R China; [Altamia, Marvin A.; Distel, Daniel L.] Northeastern Univ, Dept Marine & Environm Sci, Ocean Genome Legacy Ctr, Nahant, MA 01908 USA; [Shipway, J.

However, few studies have mechanistically linked heritable and plastic components of trait variation to generalizable processes of ecology, such as trophic cascades. Here, we assess morphological and behavioral trait variation in nine populations of common garden-reared western mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis) from three distinct ancestral predator environments (three populations per environment), each reared in the presence and absence of predator cues. We then use a pond mesocosm experiment to examine the ecological consequences of mosquitofish trait variation and density variation. Our results show significant among-population trait variation, but this variation was generally unrelated to ancestral predator environment. When traits did vary congruently with respect to ancestral predator environment, this trait variation was driven by gene-by-environment interactions. Variation in several mosquitofish traits altered the cascading effects of mosquitofish on zooplankton and primary producers, but the effect of any given trait was typically weaker than that of density. We note that the relatively stronger ecological effects of density may mask the effects of traits in some systems. Our example here shows that trait variation can be highly noncongruent with respect to a perceived selective agent, phenotypic change is a product of complex interactions between genes and the environment, and numerous interacting phenotypes generate significant but potentially cryptic cascading ecological change.","[Wood, Zachary T.; Kinnison, Michael T.] Univ Maine, Sch Biol & Ecol, Ecol & Environm Sci Program, Orono, ME 04459 USA; [Lopez, Laura K.] Univ Michigan, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Symons, Celia C.; Robinson, Rebecca R.; Palkovacs, Eric P.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Symons, Celia C.] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Irvine, CA 92697 USA","University of Maine System; University of Maine Orono; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of California System; University of California Santa Cruz; University of California System; University of California Irvine","Wood, ZT (corresponding author), Univ Maine, Sch Biol & Ecol, Ecol & Environm Sci Program, Orono, ME 04459 USA.","zachary.t.wood@maine.edu","Wood, Zachary/AAH-3650-2020","Kinnison, Michael/0000-0003-4211-2118; Symons, Celia C./0000-0003-4120-0327; Wood, Zachary/0000-0001-7369-9199","US National Science Foundation [DEB-1457333, DEB-1457112]; University of Maine Janet Waldron Fellowship Program; Australia Awards Endeavour Fellowship; University of California; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Cooperative Institute for Marine Ecosystems and Climate; USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture through the Maine Agricultural and Forest Experimental Station [ME0-31706, 3863]","US National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); University of Maine Janet Waldron Fellowship Program; Australia Awards Endeavour Fellowship(Australian GovernmentDepartment of Industry, Innovation and Science); University of California(University of California System); National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Cooperative Institute for Marine Ecosystems and Climate(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture through the Maine Agricultural and Forest Experimental Station","We thank Ben Bauer, BenWasserman, Rachel Van Gorden, Cowan Sikora, and Ethan Cantin for help with data collection and Hamish Greig, Brian Olsen, and Tim Waring for help with data analysis and manuscript preparation.

A total of 1,111 nesting green turtle samples were analyzed with 10 microsatellite markers from 20 Pacific rookeries. Population differentiation (F-ST) was significant (p <0.05) in all but 8 of 190 pairwise rookery comparisons. Pairwise F-ST values and discriminant analysis of principal components (DAPC) revealed a defined East-West split consistent with mtDNA studies. Additionally, isolation-by-distance was evaluated with estimated effective migration surfaces (EEMS). The data indicated structure throughout the Pacific rookeries largely in agreement with stock structure defined by mtDNA studies, except for some areas on the Central American and Australian continental shelves, providing evidence of possible male-mediated gene flow. The series of analyses performed did indicate that male-mediated gene flow has likely occurred where breeding migration corridors of separate populations overlap with courtship areas.

In summer and autumn, Calanus populations consist primarily of stage C5 copepodites that are storing lipids and preparing for dormancy (diapause). We collected Calanus C5 copepodites from the eastern Bering Sea shelf in early autumn of 2015 and examined whether Calanus species composition, morphometric characteristics, and lipid-related gene expression varied along a north-south gradient. The sampled area exhibited marked differences in temperature, chl a, and Calanus abundance. However, the Calanus population was surprisingly homogeneous, composed almost entirely of C. glacialis, with no evidence for latitudinal trends in prosome size, oil sac fullness, or lipid-related gene expression. Rather than a latitudinal gradient, we found that C. glacialis from 1 southern station near the Pribilof Islands were larger and exhibited lower oil sac fullness and higher expression of lipid storage genes. Gene expression changes across stations were small relative to large shifts associated with shipboard feeding experiments. The similar characteristics of C. glacialis across stations imply that most of the C5 copepodites had experienced favorable growth conditions regardless of their latitudinal location. It remains unknown how environmental conditions affect C. glacialis physiology during other parts of their life cycle or how patterns vary among years. Continued studies of C. glacialis distribution, morphometrics, and gene expression could address these questions and serve as a harbinger for responses to future climatic changes.","[Tarrant, Ann M.] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; [Eisner, Lisa B.; Kimmel, David G.] NOAA Fisheries, Alaska Fisheries Sci Ctr, Seattle, WA 98115 USA","Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA","Tarrant, AM (corresponding author), Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.","atarrant@whoi.edu","Tarrant, Ann/AAU-8263-2021; Kimmel, David/AFM-9673-2022","","","","",NA,79,6,7,0,11,"INTER-RESEARCH","OLDENDORF LUHE","NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY","0171-8630","1616-1599","","MAR ECOL PROG SER","Mar.

Here, we implement and validate an improved metagenomic approach that estimates the spatial biogeography and environmental regulation of ecotype-specific replication patterns (R-Obs) across ocean regions. A total of 719 metagenomes were analyzed from meridional Bio-GO-SHIP sections in the Atlantic and Indian Ocean. Accounting for sequencing bias and anchoring replication estimates in genome structure were critical for identifying physiologically relevant biological signals. For example, ecotypes within the dominant marine cyanobacteria Prochlorococcus exhibited distinct diel cycles in R-Obs that peaked between 19:00-22:00. Additionally, both Prochlorococcus ecotypes and ecotypes within the highly abundant heterotroph Pelagibacter (SAR11) demonstrated systematic biogeographies in R-Obs that differed from spatial patterns in relative abundance. Finally, R-Obs was significantly regulated by nutrient stress and temperature, and explained by differences in the genomic potential for nutrient transport, energy production, cell wall structure, and replication. Our results suggest that our new approach to estimating replication is reflective of gross population growth. Moreover, this work reveals that the interaction between adaptation and environmental change drives systematic variability in replication patterns across ocean basins that is ecotype-specific, adding an activity-based dimension to our understanding of microbial niche space.","[Larkin, Alyse A.; Garcia, Nathan S.; Martiny, Adam C.] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Irvine, CA 92717 USA; [Hagstrom, George, I] Princeton Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolut Biol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Brock, Melissa L.; Martiny, Adam C.] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Irvine, CA 92717 USA","University of California System; University of California Irvine; Princeton University; University of California System; University of California Irvine","Martiny, AC (corresponding author), Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Irvine, CA 92717 USA.;Martiny, AC (corresponding author), Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Irvine, CA 92717 USA.","amartiny@uci.edu","Martiny, Adam/AAC-4459-2019","Larkin, Alyse/0000-0003-4466-0791; Brock, Melissa/0000-0003-4032-9241; Martiny, Adam/0000-0003-2829-4314","National Science Foundation [OCE-1559002, OCE-1848576]; National Institutes of Health (NIH) [T32AI141346]; Simons Foundation [395890]; U.S. Department of Commerce National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) [NA18OAR4320123]","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); National Institutes of Health (NIH)(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); Simons Foundation; U.S. Department of Commerce National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)","This work was supported by the National Science Foundation (OCE-1559002 and OCE-1848576 to ACM), the National Institutes of Health (NIH T32AI141346 to MLB), the Simons Foundation (grant 395890 to GIH), and the U.S. Department of Commerce National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA grant NA18OAR4320123 supporting GIH)",NA,70,3,3,3,19,"SPRINGERNATURE","LONDON","CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND","1751-7362","1751-7370","","ISME J","ISME J.","FEB",2023,17,"2",NA,"","","",185,194,"","10.1038/s41396-022-01332-6","http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41396-022-01332-6",NA,"OCT 2022",10,"Ecology; Microbiology","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Microbiology","E4OR4",36273241,"Green Published, hybrid","","","2024-10-25","WOS:000871174100001","View Full Record in Web of Science",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) is an important aquaculture species along the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts of the United States, but increases in heavy rainfall events expose oysters to acute low salinity conditions, which negatively impact production. Low salinity survival is known to be a moderately heritable trait, but the genetic architecture underlying this trait is still poorly understood. In this study, we used ddRAD sequencing to generate genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data for four F2 families to investigate the genomic regions associated with survival in extreme low salinity (<3). SNP data were also used to assess the feasibility of genomic selection (GS) for improving this trait. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping and combined linkage disequilibrium analysis revealed significant QTL on eastern oyster chromosomes 1 and 7 underlying both survival and day to death in a 36-day experimental challenge. Significant QTL were located in genes related to DNA/RNA function and repair, ion binding and membrane transport, and general response to stress. GS was investigated using Bayesian linear regression models and prediction accuracies ranged from 0.48 to 0.57. Genomic prediction accuracies were largest using the BayesB prior and prediction accuracies did not substantially decrease when SNPs located within the QTL region on Chr1 were removed, suggesting that this trait is controlled by many genes of small effect. Our results suggest that GS will likely be a viable option for improvement of survival in extreme low salinity.","[McCarty, Alexandra J.; Plough, Louis, V] Univ Maryland, Horn Point Lab, Ctr Environm Sci, 2020 Horns Point Rd, Cambridge, MD 21613 USA; [Allen, Standish K., Jr.] Virginia Inst Marine Sci, Aquaculture Genet & Breeding Technol Ctr, Gloucester Point, VA 23062 USA","University System of Maryland; University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science; William & Mary; Virginia Institute of Marine Science","McCarty, AJ (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Horn Point Lab, Ctr Environm Sci, 2020 Horns Point Rd, Cambridge, MD 21613 USA.","amccarty@umces.edu","; Plough, Louis/E-1413-2014","McCarty, Alexandra/0000-0002-7222-5255; Plough, Louis/0000-0001-5572-9649","United States Department of Agriculture [2017-67016-26493]; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce [NA18NMF470321]; Atlantic State Marine Fisheries Commission [19-0802]; NIFA [914698, 2017-67016-26493] Funding Source: Federal RePORTER","United States Department of Agriculture(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)); National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); Atlantic State Marine Fisheries Commission; NIFA(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)National Institute of Food and Agriculture)","This study was made possible by grant 2017-67016-26493 from the United States Department of Agriculture, by award number NA18NMF470321 from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, and award 19-0802 from the Atlantic State Marine Fisheries Commission.

The SLC5A protein family includes transporters of vitamins, minerals, and nutrients. Disruption of SLC5A5 function by perchlorate, a pervasive environmental contaminant, leads to human pathologies, especially hypothyroidism. Perchlorate also disrupts the sexual development of model animals, including threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) and zebrafish (Danio rerio), but the mechanism of action is unknown. To test the hypothesis that SLC5A5 paralogs are expressed in tissues necessary for the development of reproductive organs, and therefore are plausible candidates to mediate the effects of perchlorate on sexual development, we first investigated the evolutionary history of Slc5a paralogs to better understand potential functional trajectories of the gene family. We identified two clades of slc5a paralogs with respect to an outgroup of sodium/choline cotransporters (slc5a7); these clades are the NIS clade of sodium/iodide and lactate cotransporters (slc5a5, slc5a6, slc5a8, slc5a8, and slc5a12) and the SGLT clade of sodium/glucose cotransporters (slc5a1, slc5a2, slc5a3, slc5a4, slc5a10, and slc5a11). We also characterized expression patterns of slc5a genes during development. Stickleback embryos and early larvae expressed NIS clade genes in connective tissue, cartilage, teeth, and thyroid. Stickleback males and females expressed slc5a5 and its paralogs in gonads. Single-cell transcriptomics (scRNA-seq) on zebrafish sex-genotyped gonads revealed that NIS clade-expressing cells included germ cells (slc5a5, slc5a6a, and slc5a6b) and gonadal soma cells (slc5a8l). These results are consistent with the hypothesis that perchlorate exerts its effects on sexual development by interacting with slc5a5 or its paralogs in reproductive tissues. These findings show novel expression domains of slc5 genes in stickleback and zebrafish, which suggest similar functions across vertebrates including humans, and provide candidates to mediate the effects of perchlorate on sexual development.","[Petersen, Ann M.; Small, Clayton M.; Cresko, William A.] Univ Oregon, Dept Biol, Inst Ecol & Evolut, Eugene, OR 97403 USA; [Petersen, Ann M.] NOAA, JJ Howard Marine Lab, Northeast Fisheries Sci Ctr, Sandy Hook, NJ USA; [Yan, Yi-Lin; Wilson, Catherine; Batzel, Peter; Bremiller, Ruth A.; Postlethwait, John H.] Univ Oregon, Dept Biol, Inst Neurosci, Eugene, OR 97403 USA; [Buck, C.

Corals exemplify both the need for AGF and its technical challenges; corals have declined in abundance, suffered pervasive reproductive failures, and struggled to adapt to climate change, yet mature corals cannot be easily moved for breeding, and coral gametes lose viability within hours. Here, we report the successful demonstration of AGF in corals using cryopreserved sperm that was frozen for 2 to 10 y. We fertilized Acropora palmata eggs from the western Caribbean (Curacao) with cryopreserved sperm from genetically distinct populations in the eastern and central Caribbean (Florida and Puerto Rico, respectively). We then confirmed interpopulation parentage in the Curacao-Florida offspring using 19,696 single-nucleotide polymorphism markers. Thus, we provide evidence of reproductive compatibility of a Caribbean coral across a recognized barrier to gene flow. The 6-mo survival of AGF offspring was 42%, the highest ever achieved in this species, yielding the largest wildlife population ever raised from cryopreserved material. By breeding a critically endangered coral across its range without moving adults, we show that AGF using cryopreservation is a viable conservation tool to increase genetic diversity in threatened marine populations.","[Hagedorn, Mary; Lager, Claire; Zuchowicz, Nikolas] Smithsonian Conservat Biol Inst, Ctr Species Survival, Front Royal, VA 22630 USA; [Hagedorn, Mary; Lager, Claire; Zuchowicz, Nikolas] Hawaii Inst Marine Biol, Kaneohe, HI 96744 USA; [Page, Christopher A.] Elizabeth Moore Int Ctr Coral Reef Res & Restorat, Mote Marine Lab, Summerland Key, FL 33042 USA; [O'Neil, Keri L.] Florida Aquarium, Ctr Conservat, Apollo Beach, FL 33572 USA; [Flores, Daisy M.] Univ Bremen, Dept Biol, D-28334 Bremen, Germany; [Tichy, Lucas] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Dept Microbiol, NL-6500 Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Conn, Trinity; Baums, Iliana B.] Penn State Univ, Dept Biol, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Chamberland, Valerie F.; Vermeij, Mark J.

Most of these pollutants can induce short-term, sustained or delayed impacts on developmental, physiological, and behavioral processes that are often regulated by the endocrine system in vertebrates, including fish, thus they are termed endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs). Physiological impacts resulting from the exposure of these vertebrates to EDCs include abnormalities in growth and reproductive development, as many of the prevalent chemicals are capable of binding the receptors to sex steroid hormones. The approaches employed to investigate the action and impact of EDCs is largely dependent on the specific life history and habitat of each species, and the type of chemical that organisms are exposed to. Aquatic vertebrates, such as fish, are among the first organisms to be affected by waterborne EDCs, an attribute that has justified their wide-spread use as sentinel species. Many fish species are exposed to these chemicals in the wild, for either short or prolonged periods as larvae, adults, or both, thus, studies are typically designed to focus on either acute or chronic exposure at distinct developmental stages. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of the approaches and experimental methods commonly used to characterize the effects of some of the environmentally prevalent and emerging EDCs, including 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol, nonylphenol, BPA, phthalates, and arsenic; and the pervasive and potential carriers of EDCs, microplastics, on reproduction and growth. In vivo and in vitro studies are designed and employed to elucidate the direct effects of EDCs at the organismal and cellular levels, respectively. In silico approaches, on the other hand, comprise computational methods that have been more recently applied with the potential to replace extensive in vitro screening of EDCs. These approaches are discussed in light of model species, age and duration of EDC exposure.","[Celino-Brady, Fritzie T.; Seale, Andre P.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Human Nutr Food & Anim Sci, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Lerner, Darren T.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Univ Hawaii, Sea Grant Coll Program, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA","University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa","Seale, AP (corresponding author), Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Human Nutr Food & Anim Sci, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.","seale@hawaii.edu","","Seale, Andre/0000-0003-2398-4201","National Science Foundation [IOS-1755016]; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration [NA18OAR4170347]; National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases [1R21DK111775-01]; National Institute of Food and Agriculture [HAW02051-H]","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Diabetes & Digestive & Kidney Diseases (NIDDK)); National Institute of Food and Agriculture(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)National Institute of Food and Agriculture)","This work was funded in part by grants from the National Science Foundation (IOS-1755016), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NA18OAR4170347) to AS and DL, the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (1R21DK111775-01), and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (Hatch no.

It has long been recognized that NOM plays an important role in many geological, geochemical, and environmental processes. Of particular concern is the fate of NOM in response to a warming climate in environments that have historically sequestered carbon (e.g., peatlands and swamps) but may transition to net carbon emitters. In this review, we will highlight developments in the application of high-field Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FTICR MS) in identifying the individual components of complex NOM mixtures, focusing primarily on the fraction that is dissolved in natural waters (dissolved organic matter or DOM). We will first provide some historical perspective on developments in FTICR technology that made molecular-level characterizations of DOM possible. A variety of applications of the technique will then be described, followed by our view of the future of high-field FTICR MS in carbon cycling research, including a particularly exciting metabolomic approach.","[Cooper, William T.] Florida State Univ, Dept Chem & Biochem, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; [Chanton, Jeffrey C.; Wilson, Rachel M.] Florida State Univ, Dept Earth Ocean & Atmospher Sci, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; [D'Andrilli, Juliana] Louisiana Univ Marine Consortium, Chauvin, LA 70344 USA; [Hodgkins, Suzanne B.] Ohio State Univ, Dept Microbiol, 484 W 12th Ave, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Podgorski, David C.] Univ New Orleans, Dept Chem, New Orleans, LA 70148 USA; [Stenson, Alexandra C.] Univ S Alabama, Dept Chem, Mobile, AL USA; [Tfaily, Malak M.] Univ Arizona, Dept Environm Sci, Tucson, AZ USA","State University System of Florida; Florida State University; State University System of Florida; Florida State University; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; University of Louisiana System; University of New Orleans; University of South Alabama; University of Arizona","Cooper, WT (corresponding author), Florida State Univ, Dept Chem & Biochem, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.","wcooper@fsu.edu","TFAILY, MALAK/P-2727-2019; Hodgkins, Suzanne/AAC-8580-2020; Podgorski, David/A-5532-2010","Podgorski, David/0000-0002-1070-5923; D'Andrilli, Juliana/0000-0002-3352-2564","U.S. National Science Foundation [NSF-DMR-06-54118]; National Science Foundation [NSF-EAR-0628349, NSF-EAR- 0819811, NSF-OISE-0710744]; Department of Energy [DE-SC0007144, DE-SC0004632, DE-SC0012272]; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration [NA05OAR4311162]; South Florida Water Management District; U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-SC0012272, DE-SC0004632, DE-SC0007144] Funding Source: U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)","U.S. National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); South Florida Water Management District; U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)(United States Department of Energy (DOE))","The authors would first like to thank Professor Marshall and all the students, post-docs and staff at the National High Field FT-ICR Facility for their encouragement, technical advice, and enthusiasm for what we have tried to do over these past twenty years.

Skeletal microbiomes harbored a diverse array of stress response genes, including dimethylsulfoniopropionate synthesis (dsyB) and metabolism (DMSP lyase). Furthermore, skeletal MAGs encoded an average of 22 +/- 15 genes in P. lutea and 28 +/- 23 in I. palifera with eukaryotic-like motifs thought to be involved in maintaining host association. We provide comprehensive insights into the putative functional role of the skeletal microbiome on key metabolic processes such as nitrogen fixation, dissimilatory and assimilatory nitrate, and sulfate reduction.

Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) is a noninvasive method to investigate the distribution of free-ranging species that reliably produce sound. Critically endangered Antarctic blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus intermedia) (ABWs) co-occur with pygmy blue whales (B. m. brevicauda) (PBWs) around New Zealand. Nationally, both are listed as data deficient due to difficulties in access and visual sub-species identification. PAM was used to investigate the distributions of blue whales via sub-species specific song detections in central New Zealand. Propagation models, incorporating ambient noise data, enabled the comparison of detections among recording locations in different marine environments. ABW detections peaked during austral winter and spring, indicating that New Zealand, and the South Taranaki Bight (STB) in particular, is a migratory corridor for ABWs. Some ABW calls were also detected during the breeding season (September and October). PBW calls were highly concentrated in the STB, particularly between March and May, suggesting that an aggregation of PBWs may occur here. Therefore, the STB is of great importance for both sub-species of blue whale. PBW detections were absent from the STB during parts of austral spring, but PBWs were detected at east coast locations during this time. Detection area models were valuable when interpreting and comparing detections among recording locations. The results provide sub-species specific information required for management of critically endangered ABWs and highlight the relative importance of central New Zealand for both sub-species of blue whale.","[Warren, Victoria E.; Radford, Craig A.; Constantine, Rochelle] Univ Auckland, Inst Marine Sci, Leigh Marine Lab, Leigh, New Zealand; [Warren, Victoria E.; Goetz, Kimberly T.] Natl Inst Water & Atmospher Res, Wellington, New Zealand; [Sirovic, Ana] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Marine Biol, Galveston, TX 77553 USA; [McPherson, Craig] JASCO Appl Sci Australia Pty Ltd, Capalaba, Qld, Australia; [Goetz, Kimberly T.] NOAA, Natl Marine Mammal Lab, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Alaska Fisheries Sci Ctr, Seattle, WA USA; [Constantine, Rochelle] Univ Auckland, Sch Biol Sci, Auckland, New Zealand","University of Auckland; National Institute of Water & Atmospheric Research (NIWA) - New Zealand; Texas A&M University System; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of Auckland","Warren, VE (corresponding author), Univ Auckland, Inst Marine Sci, Leigh Marine Lab, Leigh, New Zealand.;Warren, VE (corresponding author), Natl Inst Water & Atmospher Res, Wellington, New Zealand.","vwar775@aucklanduni.ac.nz","Goetz, Kimberly/AID-8232-2022","McPherson, Craig/0000-0002-9406-9994; Sirovic, Ana/0000-0001-5097-1268","University of Auckland Doctoral Scholarship; Woodside Marine Mammal Research Grant - Woodside Energy; OMV New Zealand Ltd.; Chevron New Zealand Holdings LLC; Marlborough District Council","University of Auckland Doctoral Scholarship; Woodside Marine Mammal Research Grant - Woodside Energy; OMV New Zealand Ltd.; Chevron New Zealand Holdings LLC; Marlborough District Council","VW was funded by a University of Auckland Doctoral Scholarship and the Woodside Marine Mammal Research Grant awarded by Woodside Energy.

Highly differentiated outlier loci can provide information on how genetic variation might not only contribute to local adaptation but may also be affected by historical demographic events. A locus which aligned to a predicted zona pellucida sperm-binding protein 3 gene (ZP3) in Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) was previously identified as the highest outlier based on F-ST in a RADseq study of Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus) across the West Coast of North America. However, because of the limited length of the RAD sequence and restricted geographic area of sampling, no conclusion on the functional significance of the observed variation was possible. In other marine species, ZP3 is involved in reproductive isolation, local adaptation, and has neofunctionalized as an antifreeze gene, and so it may provide important insights in functional population structure of Pacific cod. Here, we sequenced a 544-bp region of ZP3 in 230 Pacific cod collected from throughout their geographic range. We observed striking patterns of spatial structuring of ZP3 haplotypes, with a sharp break near Kodiak, Alaska, USA where populations within similar to 200 km of each other are nearly fixed for different haplotypes, contrasting a pattern of isolation by distance at other genetic markers in this region (F-ST = 0.003). Phylogenetic analysis of ZP3 haplotypes revealed that the more southern haplotypes appear to be ancestral, with the northern haplotype evolving more recently, potentially in response to a novel selective pressure as Pacific cod recolonized northern latitudes after glaciation. The sharp break in haplotype frequencies suggests strong selective pressures are operating on small spatial scales and illustrates that selection can create high divergence even in marine species with ample opportunities for gene flow.","[Spies, Ingrid] Alaska Fisheries Sci Ctr, Resource Ecol & Fisheries Management Div, 7600 Sand Point Way NE, Seattle, WA 98115 USA; [Drinan, Daniel P.; Petrou, Eleni L.; Spurr, Rory; Tarpey, Carolyn; Hartinger, Theodore; Hauser, Lorenz] Univ Washington, Sch Aquat & Fishery Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Larson, Wes] Alaska Fisheries Sci Ctr, Auke Bay Lab, Ted Stevens Marine Res Inst, Juneau, AK USA","National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA","Spies, I (corresponding author), Alaska Fisheries Sci Ctr, Resource Ecol & Fisheries Management Div, 7600 Sand Point Way NE, Seattle, WA 98115 USA.","ingrid.spies@noaa.gov","Hauser, Lorenz/E-4365-2010; Spurr, Rory/KLD-5728-2024","Hauser, Lorenz/0000-0002-9238-654X; Spies, Ingrid/0000-0002-5177-276X","Alaska Fisheries Science Center","Alaska Fisheries Science Center","Alaska Fisheries Science Center",NA,69,5,5,0,11,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","2045-7758","","","ECOL EVOL","Ecol.

When fish experience periods of insufficient food intake, they undergo slower muscle growth or even muscle wasting, and those changes emerge in part from nutritional modulation of Igf1 signaling. Here, we examined how food deprivation (fasting) affects Igf1 regulation of liver and skeletal muscle gene expression in gopher rockfish (Sebastes carnatus), a nearshore rockfish of importance for commercial and recreational fisheries in the northeastern Pacific Ocean, to understand how food limitation impacts Igf regulation of muscle growth pathways. Rockfish were either fed or fasted for 14 d, after which a subset of fish from each group was treated with recombinant Igf1 from sea bream (Sparus aurata). Fish that were fasted lost body mass and had lower body condition, reduced hepatosomatic index, and lower plasma Igf1 concentrations, as well as a decreased abundance of igf1 gene transcripts in the liver, increased hepatic mRNAs for Igf binding proteins igfbp1a, igfbp1b, and igfbp3a, and decreased mRNA abundances for igfbp2b and a putative Igf acid labile subunit (igfals) gene. In skeletal muscle, fasted fish showed a reduced abundance of intramuscular igf1 mRNAs but elevated gene transcripts encoding Igf1 receptors A (igf1ra) and B (igf1rb), which also showed downregulation by Igf1. Fasting increased skeletal muscle mRNAs for myogenin and myostatin1, as well as ubiquitin ligase F-box only protein 32 (fbxo32) and muscle RING-finger protein-1 (murf1) genes involved in muscle atrophy, while concurrently downregulating mRNAs for myoblast determination protein 2 (myod2), myostatin2, and myogenic factors 5 (myf5) and 6 (myf6 encoding Mrf4). Treatment with Igf1 downregulated muscle myostatin1 and fbxo32 under both feeding conditions, but showed feeding-dependent effects on murf1, myf5, and myf6/Mrf4 gene expression indicating that Igf1 effects on muscle growth and atrophy pathways is contingent on recent food consumption experience.","[Bersin, Theresa, V; Cordova, Kasey L.; Saenger, E.

Here we describe the transcriptomic outcomes of three different SCTLD transmission experiments performed at the Smithsonian Marine Station and Mote Marine Laboratory between 2019 and 2020 on the corals Orbicela faveolata and Montastraea cavernosa. Overall, diseased O. faveolata had 2194 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) compared with healthy colonies, whereas diseased M. cavernosa had 582 DEGs compared with healthy colonies. Many significant DEGs were implicated in immunity, extracellular matrix rearrangement, and apoptosis. These included, but not limited to, peroxidases, collagens, Bax-like, fibrinogen-like, protein tyrosine kinase, and transforming growth factor beta. A gene module was identified that was significantly correlated to disease transmission. This module possessed many apoptosis and immune genes with high module membership indicating that a complex apoptosis and immune response is occurring in corals during SCTLD transmission. Overall, we found that O. faveolata and M. cavernosa exhibit an immune, apoptosis, and tissue rearrangement response to SCTLD. We propose that future studies should focus on examining early time points of infection, before the presence of lesions, to understand the activating mechanisms involved in SCTLD.","[Traylor-Knowles, Nikki; Connelly, Michael T.; Young, Benjamin D.; DeMerlis, Allyson; Drown, Melissa K.; Goncalves, Ashley; Kron, Nicholas; Snyder, Grace A.; Martin, Cecily; Rodriguez, Kevin] Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Dept Marine Biol & Ecol, 4600 Rickenbacker Causeway, Miami, FL 33149 USA; [Eaton, Katherine; Muller, Erinn M.] Mote Marine Lab, Sarasota, FL 34236 USA; [Paul, Valerie J.; Ushijima, Blake] Smithsonian Marine Stn, Ft Pierce, FL USA; [DeMerlis, Allyson] NOAA, Atlantic Oceanog & Meteorol Lab, Ocean Chem & Ecosyst Div, Miami, FL 33149 USA; [Goncalves, Ashley] Univ Miami, Dept Biol, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA","University of Miami; Mote Marine Laboratory & Aquarium; Smithsonian Institution; Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Atlantic Oceanographic & Meteorological Laboratory (AOML); University of Miami","Traylor-Knowles, N (corresponding author), Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Dept Marine Biol & Ecol, 4600 Rickenbacker Causeway, Miami, FL 33149 USA.","ntk1717@gmail.com","Traylor-Knowles, Nikki/D-4354-2012","Goncalves, Ashley/0000-0003-4170-4242; Kron, Nicholas/0000-0002-2274-003X; Drown, Melissa/0000-0002-7350-984X; Young, Benjamin/0000-0002-5195-9399; Eaton, Katherine/0000-0002-8653-602X; Paul, Valerie/0000-0002-4691-1569; Martin, Cecily/0000-0002-6457-8800; DeMerlis, Allyson/0000-0002-6408-187X","Florida Department of Environmental Protection Office of Resilience and Coastal Protection and Coral Reef Conservation Program (DEP CRCP); National Science Foundation [1951826]; Division Of Integrative Organismal Systems; Direct For Biological Sciences [1951826] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Florida Department of Environmental Protection Office of Resilience and Coastal Protection and Coral Reef Conservation Program (DEP CRCP); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Division Of Integrative Organismal Systems; Direct For Biological Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)NSF - Division of Integrative Organismal Systems (IOS))","dThe collection, processing and analysis of this work was funded by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection Office of Resilience and Coastal Protection and Coral Reef Conservation Program (DEP CRCP) and by the National Science Foundation Grant number: 1951826.",NA,82,17,21,5,28,"FRONTIERS MEDIA SA","LAUSANNE","AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND","","2296-7745","","FRONT MAR SCI","Front.

Given the importance of P, numerous methods are available to assess P stress in phytoplankton communities. Marine phytoplankton are known to substitute sulfolipids for phospholipids in response to P limitation. We asked whether sulfolipid substitution might serve as an additional indicator of P stress in freshwater phytoplankton communities. The question was addressed using cultures of Microcystis aeruginosa, Lake Erie microcosms, and surveys of lipid profiles in Lake Erie during a Microcystis spp. bloom. Peak area response ratios of the intact polar lipids sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerol (SQDG) to phosphatidylglycerol (PG) were used as the metric of lipid substitution. In cultures of M. aeruginosa NIES-843, the SQDG : PG ratio increased from similar to 0.9 to similar to 3.3 with decreasing P concentration. In P-limited communities, the SQDG : PG ratio increased from similar to 6 to similar to 11 after 48 h in microcosm controls, while P amendments reduced the ratio to similar to 3. In Lake Erie surveys, the SQDG : PG ratio ranged from similar to 0.4 to similar to 7.4 and was negatively correlated (Pearson r = similar to 0.62) with total dissolved P.

However, the molecular mechanisms generating these rhythms remain far from understood. The aim of this study was to investigate seasonal differences in gene expression in three different latitudinal regions (South Georgia, South Orkneys/Bransfield Strait, Lazarev Sea) and to identify genes with potential regulatory roles in the seasonal life cycle of Antarctic krill. The RNA-seq data were analysed (a) for seasonal differences between summer and winter krill sampled from each region, and (b) for regional differences within each season. A large majority of genes showed an up-regulation in summer krill in all regions with respect to winter krill. However, seasonal differences in gene expression were less pronounced in Antarctic krill from South Georgia, most likely due to the milder seasonal conditions of the lower latitudes of this region, with a less extreme light regime and food availability between summer and winter. Our results suggest that in the South Orkneys/Bransfield Strait and Lazarev Sea region, Antarctic krill entered a state of metabolic depression and regressed development (winter quiescence) in winter. Moreover, seasonal gene expression signatures seem to be driven by a photoperiodic timing system that may adapt the flexible behaviour and physiology of Antarctic krill to the highly seasonal environment according to the latitudinal region. However, at the lower latitude South Georgia region, food availability might represent the main environmental cue influencing seasonal physiology.","[Hoering, Flavia; Harms, Lars; Meyer, Bettina] Helmholtz Ctr Polar & Marine Res, Alfred Wegener Inst, Handelshafen 12, Bremerhaven, Germany; [Hoering, Flavia; Meyer, Bettina] Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Inst Chem & Biol Marine Environm, Carl von Ossietzky Str 9-11, D-26111 Oldenburg, Germany; [Biscontin, Alberto; Sales, Gabriele; De Pitta, Cristiano] Univ Padua, Dipartimento Biol, Via Ugo Bassi 58b, I-35121 Padua, Italy; [Harms, Lars; Meyer, Bettina] Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Helmholtz Inst Funct Marine Biodivers, HIFMB, Ammerlander Heerstr 231, D-26129 Oldenburg, Germany; [Reiss, Christian S.] NOAA, Antarctic Ecosyst Res Div, Southwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA","Helmholtz Association; Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar & Marine Research; Carl von Ossietzky Universitat Oldenburg; University of Padua; Carl von Ossietzky Universitat Oldenburg; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA","Meyer, B (corresponding author), Helmholtz Ctr Polar & Marine Res, Alfred Wegener Inst, Handelshafen 12, Bremerhaven, Germany.;Meyer, B (corresponding author), Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Inst Chem & Biol Marine Environm, Carl von Ossietzky Str 9-11, D-26111 Oldenburg, Germany.;De Pitt, C (corresponding author), Univ Padua, Dipartimento Biol, Via Ugo Bassi 58b, I-35121 Padua, Italy.;Meyer, B (corresponding author), Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Helmholtz Inst Funct Marine Biodivers, HIFMB, Ammerlander Heerstr 231, D-26129 Oldenburg, Germany.","cristiano.depitta@unipd.it; bettina.meyer@awi.de","Meyer, Bettina/ABB-5311-2020; De Pitta, Cristiano/AAY-7302-2020; Sales, Gabriele/K-5065-2016","Meyer, Bettina/0000-0001-6804-9896; Horing, Flavia/0000-0002-0618-7481; Biscontin, Alberto/0000-0003-1492-7715; De Pitta, Cristiano/0000-0001-8013-8162; Sales, Gabriele/0000-0003-2078-5661","Helmholtz Virtual Institute Polar-Time [VH-VI-500]; ministry of science and culture (MWK) of Lower Saxony, Germany (Research Training Group IBR Interdisciplinary approach to functional biodiversity research); Programma Nazionale di Ricerche in Antartide - PNRA [2016_00225]","Helmholtz Virtual Institute Polar-Time; ministry of science and culture (MWK) of Lower Saxony, Germany (Research Training Group IBR Interdisciplinary approach to functional biodiversity research); Programma Nazionale di Ricerche in Antartide - PNRA","This work was supported by the Helmholtz Virtual Institute Polar-Time (VH-VI-500: Biological timing in a changing marine environment - clocks and rhythms in polar pelagic organisms), and the ministry of science and culture (MWK) of Lower Saxony, Germany (Research Training Group IBR Interdisciplinary approach to functional biodiversity research) as well as the Programma Nazionale di Ricerche in Antartide - PNRA (grant 2016_00225 to AB).

Kelp, brown macroalgae in the order Laminariales, play a vital role in coastal ecosystems, yet we know little about the functional role of the microbial symbionts that cover their photosynthetic surfaces. Here, we reconstructed 79 bacterial metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from blades of the bull kelp, Nereocystis luetkeana, allowing us to determine their metabolic potential and functional roles. Despite the annual life history of bull kelp, nearly half of the bacterial MAGs were detected across multiple years. Diverse members of the kelp microbiome, spanning 6 bacterial phyla, contained genes for transporting and assimilating dissolved organic matter (DOM), which is secreted by kelp in large quantities and likely fuels the metabolism of these heterotrophic bacteria. Bacterial genomes also contained alginate lyase and biosynthesis genes, involved in polysaccharide degradation and biofilm formation, respectively. Kelp-associated bacterial genomes contained genes for dissimilatory nitrate reduction and urea hydrolysis, likely providing a reduced source of nitrogen to the host kelp. The genome of the most abundant member of the kelp microbiome and common macroalgal symbiont, Granulosicoccus, contained a full suite of genes for synthesizing cobalamin (vitamin B,,), suggesting that kelp-associated bacteria have the potential to provide their host kelp with vitamins. Finally, kelp-associated Granulosicoccus contained genes that typify the aerobic anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria, including genes for bacteriochlorophyll synthesis and photosystem II reaction center proteins, making them the first known photoheterotrophic representatives of this genus. IMPORTANCE Kelp (brown algae in the order Laminariales) are foundational species that create essential habitat in temperate and arctic coastal marine ecosystems. These photosynthetic giants host millions of microbial taxa whose functions are relatively unknown, despite their potential importance for host-microbe interactions and nutrient cycling in kelp forest ecosystems. We reconstructed bacterial genomes from metagenomic samples collected from blades of the bull kelp, Nereocystis luetkeana, allowing us to determine the functional gene content of specific members of the kelp microbiome. These bacterial genomes spanned 6 phyla and 19 families and included common alga-associated microbial symbionts such as Granulosicoccus. Key functions encoded in kelp-associated bacterial genomes included dissolved organic matter assimilation, alginate metabolism, vitamin B-12 biosynthesis, and nitrogen reduction from nitrate and urea to ammonium, potentially providing the host kelp with vitamins and reduced nitrogen.","[Weigel, Brooke L.] Univ Chicago, Comm Evolutionary Biol, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Miranda, Khashiff K.] Univ Chicago, Coll, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Fogarty, Emily C.; Watson, Andrea R.] Univ Chicago, Comm Microbiol, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Fogarty, Emily C.; Watson, Andrea R.] Univ Chicago, Dept Med, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Pfister, Catherine A.] Univ Chicago, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Chicago, IL 60637 USA","University of Chicago; University of Chicago; University of Chicago; University of Chicago; University of Chicago","Weigel, BL (corresponding author), Univ Chicago, Comm Evolutionary Biol, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.","blweigel@uw.edu","Weigel, Brooke/AAI-4152-2020","Fogarty, Emily/0000-0002-8957-9922; Watson, Andrea/0000-0003-0128-6795; Weigel, Brooke/0000-0002-6271-9083; Miranda, Khashiff/0000-0002-0155-2857; Pfister, Catherine/0000-0003-0892-637X","Climate Change Initiative - Rebecca Susan Buffett Foundation; Phycological Society of America; NOAA-COCA [NA160AR431055]; Washington Department of Natural Resources [93099282]; NSF-DEB [1556874]; GAANN fellowship from the Department of Education; Washington State DNR; Committee on Evolutionary Biology at the University of Chicago; Division Of Environmental Biology; Direct For Biological Sciences [1556874] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Climate Change Initiative - Rebecca Susan Buffett Foundation; Phycological Society of America; NOAA-COCA; Washington Department of Natural Resources; NSF-DEB(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)); GAANN fellowship from the Department of Education(US Department of Education); Washington State DNR; Committee on Evolutionary Biology at the University of Chicago; Division Of Environmental Biology; Direct For Biological Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO))","This research was supported by the Climate Change Initiative funded by the Rebecca Susan Buffett Foundation, a Phycological Society of America Grant awarded to B.L.W., NOAA-COCA (no.

In this respect, the development of education and research programs that bridge genome science with ''place'' and world-views specific to a given region are valuable for Indigenous students and educators. Through a multi-institutional collaboration, we developed an ongoing education program and model that includes Illumina and Oxford Nanopore sequencing, free bioinformatic platforms, and teacher training workshops to address our research and education goals through a place-based science education lens. High school students and researchers cultivated, sequenced, assembled, and annotated the genomes of 13 bacteria from Mars analog sites with cultural relevance, 10 of which were novel species. Students, teachers, and community members assisted with the discovery of new, potentially chemolithotrophic bacteria relevant to astrobiology. This joint education-research program also led to the discovery of species from Mars analog sites capable of producing N-acyl homoserine lactones, which are quorum-sensing molecules used in bacterial communication. Whole genome sequencing was completed in high school classrooms, and connected students to funded space research, increased research output, and provided culturally relevant, place-based science education, with participants naming three novel species described here. Students at St. Andrew's School (Honolulu, Hawai'i) proposed the name Bradyrhizobium prioritasuperba for the type strain, BL16A(T), of the new species (DSM 112479(T) = NCTC 14602(T)).

A multi-year Brownie estimator was developed to test the accuracy and precision of exploitation rate estimates arising from gene tagging programs with various scenarios for spatial release distribution, release numbers and fishery exploitation rates. Harvest strategies that used the Brownie estimator were tested to evaluate yield and resource conservation performance relative to idealized management using perfect information. For the eastern stock, releasing 1,000 fish throughout the Atlantic and genotyping 27% of all landed fish at an estimated cost of US$2M was sufficient to obtain estimates of exploitation rate with a coefficient of variation of 20%. For the western stock, the same precision in exploitation rate estimates required the release of 1,300 fish and genotyping rate of 35% at an estimated cost of US$2.5M. Harvest strategies using the gene tagging data provided expected yield and resource conservation performance that was not substantially lower than a harvest strategy assuming using perfect information regarding vulnerable biomass.

However, for fish experiencing food limitation, elevated blood Gh can occur even with low circulating Igf1 and slow growth, suggesting that nutritional stress can alter the sensitivity of liver Igf1 synthesis pathways to Gh. Here, we examined how recent feeding experience affected Gh regulation of liver Igf1 synthesis pathways in juvenile gopher rockfish (Sebastes carnatus) to illuminate mechanisms underlying the nutritional modulation of Igf1 production. Juvenile gopher rockfish were maintained under conditions of feeding or complete food deprivation (fasting) for 14 d and then treated with recombinant sea bream (Sparus aurata) Gh or saline control. Gh upregulated hepatic igf1 mRNA levels in fed fish but not in fasted fish. The liver of fasted rockfish also showed a lower relative abundance of gene transcripts encoding teleost Gh receptors 1 (ghr1) and 2 (ghr2), as well as reduced protein levels of phosphorylated janus tyrosine kinase 2 (pJak2) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (pStat5), which function to induce igf1 gene transcription following Gh binding to Gh receptors. Relative hepatic mRNA levels for suppressors of cytokine signaling (Socs) genes socs2, socs3a, and socs3b were also lower in fasted rockfish. Socs2 can suppress Gh activation of Jak2/Stat5, and fasting-related variation in socs expression may reflect modulated inhibitory control of igf1 gene transcription. Fasted rockfish also had elevated liver mRNA abundances for lipolytic hormone-sensitive lipase 1 (hsl1) and Igf binding proteins igfbp1a,-1b and -3a, reduced liver mRNAs encoding igfbp2b and an Igfbp acid labile subunit-like (igfals) gene, and higher transcript abundances for Igf1 receptors igf1ra and igf1rb in skeletal muscle. Together, these findings suggest that food deprivation impacts liver Igf1 responsiveness to Gh via multiple mechanisms that include a downregulation of hepatic Gh receptors, modulation of the intracellular Jak2/Stat5 transduction pathway, and possible shifts in Socs-inhibitory control of igf1 gene transcription, while also demonstrating that these changes occur in concert with shifts in liver Igfbp expression and muscle Gh/Igf1 signaling pathway components.","[Bersin, Theresa V.; Cordova, Kasey L.; Lema, Sean C.] Calif Polytech State Univ San Luis Obispo, Ctr Coastal Marine Sci, Biol Sci Dept, San Luis Obispo, CA 93407 USA; [Journey, Meredith L.] Lynker Technol, 202 Church St SE 536, Leesburg, VA 20175 USA; [Journey, Meredith L.; Beckman, Brian R.] NOAA, Environm & Fisheries Sci Div, Northwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Seattle, WA 98112 USA; [Lema, Sean C.] Univ Wyoming, Dept Zool & Physiol, Wyoming Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, Laramie, WY 82071 USA","California State University System; California Polytechnic State University San Luis Obispo; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of Wyoming","Lema, SC (corresponding author), Calif Polytech State Univ San Luis Obispo, Ctr Coastal Marine Sci, Biol Sci Dept, San Luis Obispo, CA 93407 USA.;Lema, SC (corresponding author), Univ Wyoming, Dept Zool & Physiol, Wyoming Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, Laramie, WY 82071 USA.","slema@calpoly.edu","","Lema, Sean/0000-0002-2564-8992","California Sea Grant [R/HCME-15]; Cal-Neva Chapter of the American Fisheries Society (AFS); Dr. Earl H.

Previous studies limited to mtDNA suggest that the swimming crab Callinectes ornatus Ordway, 1863 exists as two distinct genetic clusters separated by the AOP. However, questions concerning migration, diversification time, and species delimitation are unresolved. Densely sampling markers across the genome (SNPs) could elucidate the evolutionary processes within this species. Here, we combined mtDNA data and ddRAD-seq to explore the diversification patterns and processes within the swimming crab C. ornatus. We show great genetic differentiation between groups on the north and south sides of the plume but also signs of hybridization. Demographic modeling indicates the divergence between groups starting around 8 Mya following the AOP's formation. After a period of isolation, we detect two incidences of secondary contact with stronger migration in concordance with the North Brazil Current flow. Our results suggest speciation with gene flow explained by the interplay among the AOP, oceanographic currents, and long larval dispersal. This work represents the first investigation employing ddRAD-seq in a marine invertebrate species with distribution encompassing the north and south Atlantic and sheds light on the role of the AOP in the diversification of a marine species.","[Peres, Pedro A.; Bracken-Grissom, Heather] Florida Int Univ FIU, Inst Environm, Dept Biol, Miami, FL 33199 USA; [Peres, Pedro A.; Mantelatto, Fernando L.] Univ Sao Paulo, Fac Philosophy Sci & Letters Ribeirao Preto FFCLR, Lab Bioecol & Systemat Crustaceans LBSC, BR-14040901 Ribeirao Preto, Brazil; [Bracken-Grissom, Heather] Natl Museum Nat Hist Smithsonian, Dept Invertebrate Zool, Washington, WA USA; [Timm, Laura E.] Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Coll Fisheries & Ocean Sci, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA; [Timm, Laura E.] NOAA Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Alaska Fisheries Sci Ctr, Auke Bay Labs, Juneau, AK 99801 USA","State University System of Florida; Florida International University; Universidade de Sao Paulo; University of Alaska System; University of Alaska Fairbanks; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA","Peres, PA (corresponding author), Florida Int Univ FIU, Inst Environm, Dept Biol, Miami, FL 33199 USA.;Peres, PA (corresponding author), Univ Sao Paulo, Fac Philosophy Sci & Letters Ribeirao Preto FFCLR, Lab Bioecol & Systemat Crustaceans LBSC, BR-14040901 Ribeirao Preto, Brazil.","pedro.peres27@gmail.com","; Fapesp, Biota/F-8655-2017; Mantelatto, Fernando L./H-2695-2012","Bracken-Grissom, Heather/0000-0002-4919-6679; Fapesp, Biota/0000-0002-9887-8449; Mantelatto, Fernando L./0000-0002-8497-187X","Sao Paulo Research Foundation-FAPESP [2017/12376-6]; FAPESP [2010/50188-8, 2018/13685-5]; Colecoes Cientificas [2009/54931-0]; PROTAX [2016/50376-5]; Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico-CNPq [301359/2007-5, 473050/2007-2, 302748/2010-5, 471011/2011-8, PQ 302253/2019-0]; Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal-CAPES [001, II-2005/2014-23038.004308/201414]; National Science Foundation Division of Biology [DEB-1856667]","Sao Paulo Research Foundation-FAPESP(Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP)); FAPESP(Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP)); Colecoes Cientificas; PROTAX; Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico-CNPq(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal-CAPES(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)); National Science Foundation Division of Biology","This research resulted from the PhD dissertation of Pedro A.

This study developed a site-specific risk assessment using a novel approach that combined quantitative PCR-based measurement of microbial source tracking (MST) genetic markers (human, dog, and gull fecal bacteria) with a QMRA analysis of potential pathogen risk. Water samples (n = 24) from two recreational beaches were collected and analyzed for MST markers as part of a broader Beach Exposure And Child Health Study that examined child behavior interactions with the beach environment. We report here the measurements of fecal bacteria MST markers in the environmental DNA extracts of those samples and a QMRA analysis of potential health risks utilizing the results from the MST measurements in the water samples. Human-specific Bacteroides was enumerated by the HF183 Taqman qPCR assay, gull-specific Catellicoccus was enumerated by the Gull2 qPCR assay, and dog-specific Bacteroides was enumerated by the DogBact qPCR assay. Derived reference pathogen doses, calculated from the MST marker concentrations detected in recreational waters, were used to estimate the risk of gastrointestinal illness for both children and adults. Dose-response equations were used to estimate the probability of the risk of infection (Pinf) per a swimming exposure event. Based on the QMRA simulations presented in this study, the GI risk from swimming or playing in water containing a mixture of human and non-human fecal sources appear to be primarily driven by the human fecal source. However, the estimated median GI health risk for both beaches never exceeded the U.S. EPA risk threshold of 32 illnesses per 1,000 recreation events. Our research suggests that utilizing QMRA together with MST can further extend our understanding of potential recreational bather risk by identifying the source contributing the greatest risk in a particular location, therefore informing beach management responses and decision-making.","[Gitter, Anna; Mena, Kristina D.] Univ Texas Hlth Sci Ctr Houston, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Epidemiol Human Genet & Environm Sci, El Paso, TX 77030 USA; [Gidley, Maribeth] Univ Miami, Cooperat Inst Marine & Atmospher Studies, Miami, FL USA; [Gidley, Maribeth; Sinigalliano, Christopher] NOAA, Atlantic Oceanog & Meteorol Lab, Miami, FL USA; [Ferguson, Alesia] North Carolina Agr & Tech State Univ, Dept Built Environm, Greensboro, NC USA; [Bonacolta, Anthony] Univ Miami, Dept Marine Biol & Ecol, Miami, FL USA; [Bonacolta, Anthony] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Inst Biol Evolut, CSIC, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain; [Solo-Gabriele, Helena] Univ Miami, Dept Chem Environm & Mat Engn, Coral Gables, FL USA","University of Texas System; University of Texas Health Science Center Houston; University of Miami; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Atlantic Oceanographic & Meteorological Laboratory (AOML); University of North Carolina; North Carolina A&T State University; University of Miami; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC-UPF - Institut de Biologia Evolutiva (IBE); Pompeu Fabra University; University of Miami","Gitter, A (corresponding author), Univ Texas Hlth Sci Ctr Houston, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Epidemiol Human Genet & Environm Sci, El Paso, TX 77030 USA.","anna.gitter@uth.tmc.edu","Bonacolta, Anthony/JCE-6385-2023","Bonacolta, Anthony/0000-0003-1439-5907","The broader study supporting this project (Beach Exposure And Child Health Study, BEACHES) was funded by The Gulf of Mexico Research Initiative (GoMRI), USA (award number G-231817).

Although RNA yield varied widely (range, 0-265.2 ng; mean = 85.8; SD = 71.3), measurable RNA was extracted from 97% of the samples. Extracted RNA was assessed in 1-6 PCR reactions targeting housekeeping genes (Rpl8, Gapdh or ActB) or genes associated with immune function (TNF alpha, IL-12p40 or Cox-2). Fifty of the aquarium samples (93%) amplified at least one transcript; overall PCR success for housekeeping genes (96/110, 87%) and genes associated with immune function (90/104, 87%) were similarly high. Both RNA yield and overall PCR success (27%) were lower for wild beluga samples, which is most likely due to the reduced forcefulness of the exhale when compared with trained or free-swimming belugas. Overall, the high detection rate with PCR suggests measuring gene expression in blow samples could provide diagnostic information about immune responses within the respiratory tract. While further study is required to determine if quantitative gene expression data from blow samples is associated with disease states, the non-invasive nature of this approach may prove valuable for belugas, which face increasing anthropogenic disturbances.","[Richard, Justin T.; Schultz, Krystle; Sartini, Becky L.] Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Fisheries Anim & Vet Sci, 9 E Alumni Dr, Kingston, RI 02881 USA; [Richard, Justin T.; Romano, Tracy A.] Myst Aquarium, 55 Coogan Blvd, Mystic, CT 06355 USA; [Goertz, Caroline E.

When located at the equatorial edge of a species' range, these populations may also harbor genetic diversity related to survival and reproduction at higher temperatures, a critical resource for marine species facing warming ocean temperatures. Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus), a marine fish in the North Pacific, has already experienced major shifts in biomass and distribution linked to climate change. We estimated the magnitude and direction of connectivity between peripheral populations of Pacific cod at the southern edge of the species' range, by conducting restriction site-associated DNA (RAD) sequencing and individual assignment on fish collected around the Korean Peninsula during the spawning season. Three populations on the western, eastern, and southern Korean coasts were highly differentiated (F-ST = 0.025-0.042) and relatively small (N-e = 433-1,777). Ten putative dispersers and estimates of contemporary migration rates revealed asymmetrical, west-to-east movement around the Korean Peninsula, at a higher rate than predicted by indirect estimates of connectivity (F-ST). Allele frequencies at 87 RAD loci were decisively correlated with strong marine temperature gradients between the warmer southern coast and the cooler waters of the eastern and western coasts. Despite relatively small sample sizes, our data suggest asymmetrical dispersal and gene flow, potentially involving adaptive alleles, between peripheral populations inhabiting markedly different thermal regimes. Our study emphasizes the conservation value of peripheral populations in high gene flow marine fish species.","[Fisher, Mary C.; Hauser, Lorenz] Univ Washington, Sch Aquat & Fishery Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Helser, Thomas E.] NOAA, Resource Ecol & Fisheries Management Div, Alaska Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Seattle, WA 98115 USA; [Kang, Sukyung] Natl Inst Fisheries Sci, Fisheries Resources Management Div, Busan, South Korea; [Gwak, Wooseok] Gyeongsang Natl Univ, Inst Marine Ind, Tongyeong, South Korea; [Canino, Michael F.] NOAA, Alaska Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Seattle, WA 98115 USA; [Fisher, Mary C.] Univ Washington, Sch Environm & Forest Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; National Institute of Fisheries Science; Gyeongsang National University; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle","Fisher, MC (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Sch Environm & Forest Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.","mfisher5@uw.edu","Hauser, Lorenz/E-4365-2010","Fisher, Mary/0000-0003-0729-3929","National Research Foundation of Korea [NRF-2012R1A1A2004830]; National Institute of Fisheries Science [R2021069]","National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea); National Institute of Fisheries Science","National Research Foundation of Korea, Grant/Award Number: NRF-2012R1A1A2004830; National Institute of Fisheries Science, Grant/Award Number: R2021069",NA,100,8,10,2,16,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","2045-7758","","","ECOL EVOL","Ecol.

Chromosome inversions and sex-determining regions are often involved in adaptation, allowing for the inheritance of co-adapted gene complexes and for the resolution of sexually antagonistic selection through sex-specific partitioning of genetic variants. Genomic features such as these can escape detection when loci with LD are removed; in addition, failing to account for these features can introduce bias to analyses. We examined patterns of LD using network analysis to identify an overlapping chromosome inversion and sex-determining region in chum salmon. The signal of the inversion was strong enough to show up as false population substructure when the entire dataset was analyzed, while the effect of the sex-determining region on population structure was only obvious after restricting analysis to the sex chromosome. Understanding the extent and geographic distribution of inversions is now a critically important part of genetic analyses of natural populations. Our results highlight the importance of analyzing and understanding patterns of LD in genomic dataset and the perils of excluding or ignoring loci exhibiting LD. Blindly excluding loci in LD would have prevented detection of the sex-determining region and chromosome inversion while failing to understand the genomic features leading to high-LD could have resulted in false interpretations of population structure.","[McKinney, Garrett; McPhee, Megan V.] Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Coll Fisheries & Ocean Sci, 17101 Point Lena Loop Rd, Juneau, AK 99801 USA; [McKinney, Garrett; Pascal, Carita; Seeb, James E.; Seeb, Lisa W.] Univ Washington, Sch Aquat & Fishery Sci, 1122 NE Boat St,Box 355020, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [McKinney, Garrett] NOAA, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Northwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, 2725 Montlake Blvd E, Seattle, WA 98112 USA","University of Alaska System; University of Alaska Fairbanks; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA","McKinney, G (corresponding author), Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Coll Fisheries & Ocean Sci, 17101 Point Lena Loop Rd, Juneau, AK 99801 USA.","gjmckinn@uw.edu","Seeb, Lisa/GSN-3076-2022","Seeb, Lisa/0000-0002-0626-9743","Pollock Cooperative Conservation and Research Center; Bureau of Energy Management [CFDA 15.668, F12AF00424]","Pollock Cooperative Conservation and Research Center; Bureau of Energy Management","We would like to thank Bill Templin, Chris Habicht, and Sara GilkBaumer from the Alaska Department of Fish and Game (ADFG) for their support and assistance during this project.

However, concentrated genomic architecture (i.e., genomic islands of divergence) can suppress recombination to allow evolution of local adaptations despite high gene flow. Pacific lamprey (Entosphenus tridentatus) is a highly dispersive anadromous fish. Observed trait diversity and evidence for genetic basis of traits suggests it may be locally adapted. We addressed whether concentrated genomic architecture could influence local adaptation for Pacific lamprey. Using two new whole genome assemblies and genotypes from 7,716 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) loci in 518 individuals from across the species range, we identified four genomic islands of divergence (on chromosomes 01, 02, 04, and 22). We determined robust phenotype-by-genotype relationships by testing multiple traits across geographic sites. These trait associations probably explain genomic divergence across the species' range. We genotyped a subset of 302 broadly distributed SNPs in 2,145 individuals for association testing for adult body size, sexual maturity, migration distance and timing, adult swimming ability, and larval growth. Body size traits were strongly associated with SNPs on chromosomes 02 and 04. Moderate associations also implicated SNPs on chromosome 01 as being associated with variation in female maturity. Finally, we used candidate SNPs to extrapolate a heterogeneous spatiotemporal distribution of these predicted phenotypes based on independent data sets of larval and adult collections. These maturity and body size results guide future elucidation of factors driving regional optimization of these traits for fitness. Pacific lamprey is culturally important and imperiled. This research addresses biological uncertainties that challenge restoration efforts.","[Hess, Jon E.; Graves, David; Porter, Laurie L.; Silver, Greg] Columbia River Intertribal Fish Commiss, 700 NE Multnomah St,Suite 1200, Portland, OR 97232 USA; [Smith, Jeramiah J.; Timoshevskaya, Nataliya] Univ Kentucky, Dept Biol, Lexington, KY USA; [Baker, Cyndi] Oregon Dept Fish & Wildlife, Clackamas, OR USA; [Caudill, Christopher C.; Keefer, Matthew L.] Univ Idaho, Moscow, ID 83843 USA; [Kinziger, Andrew P.] Humboldt State Univ, Arcata, CA 95521 USA; [Moser, Mary L.] NOAA, NWFSC, Seattle, WA USA; [Whitlock, Steven L.] Univ Washington, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Narum, Shawn R.] Columbia River Intertribal Fish Commiss, Hagerman, ID USA","University of Kentucky; University of Idaho; California State University System; California State Polytechnic University, Humboldt; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle","Hess, JE (corresponding author), Columbia River Intertribal Fish Commiss, 700 NE Multnomah St,Suite 1200, Portland, OR 97232 USA.","hesj@critfc.org","Smith, Jeramiah/D-3537-2011; Timoshevskaya, Nataliya/ABH-8993-2020; Caudill, Christopher/M-7906-2014; Hess, Jon/F-5124-2012","Caudill, Christopher/0000-0002-7129-8620; Hess, Jon/0000-0002-3643-202X; Smith, Jeramiah/0000-0001-5333-5531; Timoshevskaya, Nataliya/0000-0002-9775-5877","Bonneville Power Administration [2008-524-00]","Bonneville Power Administration","Bonneville Power Administration, Grant/Award Number: 2008-524-00",NA,48,27,27,1,24,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","0962-1083","1365-294X","","MOL ECOL","Mol.

There have been concerns about the genetic effects of such propagation, but few studies have measured this directly at a genomic level. Here, we use moderate-coverage (10X) genome sequences from 80 individuals to evaluate the genomic distribution of variation of several paired groups of Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha). These include (1) captive- and natural-origin fish separated by at least one generation, (2) fish within the same generation having high fitness in captivity compared to those with high fitness in the wild, and (3) fish listed as different Evolutionarily Significant Units (ESUs) under the US Endangered Species Act. The distribution of variation between high-fitness captive and high-fitness natural fish was nearly identical to that expected from random sampling, indicating that differential selection in the two environments did not create large allele frequency differences within a single generation. In contrast, the samples from distinct ESUs were clearly more divergent than expected by chance, including a peak of divergence near the GREB1L gene on chromosome 28, a gene previously associated with variation in time of return to fresh water. Comparison of hatchery- and natural-origin fish within a population fell between these extremes, but the maximum value of F-ST was similar to the maximum between ESUs, including a peak of divergence on chromosome 8 near the slc7a2 and pdgfrl genes. These results suggest that efforts at limiting genetic divergence between captive and natural fish in these populations have successfully kept the average divergence low across the genome, but at a small portion of their genomes, hatchery and natural salmon were as distinct as individuals from different ESUs.","[Ford, Michael J.; Berntson, Ewann A.; Moran, Paul] NOAA, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Northwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Conservat Biol Div, 2725 Montlake Blvd E, Seattle, WA 98112 USA; [McKinney, Garrett J.] Washington Dept Fish & Wildlife, Mol Genet Lab, Olympia, WA 98501 USA","National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Washington Department of Fish & Wildlife (WDFW)","Ford, MJ (corresponding author), NOAA, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Northwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Conservat Biol Div, 2725 Montlake Blvd E, Seattle, WA 98112 USA.","mike.ford@noaa.gov","Moran, Paul/B-1740-2010","Ford, Michael/0000-0002-3517-1534","Bonneville Power Administration","Bonneville Power Administration","This work was funded in part by the Bonneville Power Administration.",NA,64,4,5,1,17,"SPRINGER","DORDRECHT","VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","1566-0621","1572-9737","","CONSERV GENET","Conserv.

We used genomic-based estimates of inbreeding to investigate their relationship with eight adult traits in a captive-reared Pacific salmonid that is released into the wild. Estimates were also used to determine whether alternative broodstock management approaches reduced risks of inbreeding. Specifically, 1,100 unlinked restriction-site associated (RAD) loci were used to compare pairwise relatedness, derived from a relationship matrix, and individual inbreeding, estimated by comparing observed and expected homozygosity, across four generations in two hatchery lines of Chinook salmon that were derived from the same source. The lines are managed as integrated with the founding wild stock, with ongoing gene flow, and as segregated with no gene flow. While relatedness and inbreeding increased in the first generation of both lines, possibly due to population subdivision caused by hatchery initiation, the integrated line had significantly lower levels in some subsequent generations (relatedness: F-2-F-4; inbreeding F-2). Generally, inbreeding was similar between the lines despite large differences in effective numbers of breeders. Inbreeding did not affect fecundity, reproductive effort, return timing, fork length, weight, condition factor, and daily growth coefficient. However, it delayed spawn timing by 1.75 days per one standard deviation increase in F (0.16). The results indicate that integrated management may reduce inbreeding but also suggest that it is relatively low in a small, segregated hatchery population that maximized number of breeders. Our findings demonstrate the utility of genomics to monitor inbreeding under alternative management strategies in captive breeding programs.","[Waters, Charles D.; Naish, Kerry A.] Univ Washington, Sch Aquat & Fishery Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Hard, Jeffrey J.] NOAA, Conservat Biol Div, Northwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Seattle, WA USA; [Fast, David E.; Bosch, William J.] Yakama Nation Fisheries, Toppenish, WA USA; [Knudsen, Curtis M.] Oncorh Consulting, Olympia, WA USA; [Waters, Charles D.] NOAA, Auke Bay Labs, Alaska Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Juneau, AK USA","University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)","Waters, CD (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Sch Aquat & Fishery Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.","charlie.waters@noaa.gov","Knudsen, Curtis/A-7277-2009; Naish, Kerry-Ann/F-5768-2014","Hard, Jeffrey/0000-0003-1420-5464; Naish, Kerry-Ann/0000-0002-3275-8778","Washington Sea Grant [R/HCE-4]; National Marine Fisheries Service-Sea Grant Fellowship in Population and Ecosystem Dynamics [R/E/I-26]; University of Washington","Washington Sea Grant; National Marine Fisheries Service-Sea Grant Fellowship in Population and Ecosystem Dynamics; University of Washington(University of Washington)","Washington Sea Grant, Grant/Award Number: R/HCE-4; National Marine Fisheries Service-Sea Grant Fellowship in Population and Ecosystem Dynamics, Grant/Award Number: R/E/I-26; Hall Conservation Genetics Research Award from the University of Washington",NA,96,10,12,1,23,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","0962-1083","1365-294X","","MOL ECOL","Mol.

Igf1 signaling, however, also involves several distinct IGF binding proteins (Igfbps), and the functional roles of many of these Igfbps in affecting growth during shifting food availability remain uncertain. Here, we tested how complete food deprivation (fasting) affected gene transcription for paralogs of all six types of Igfbps in the liver and fast-twitch skeletal muscle of cabezon (Scorpaenichthys marmoratus), a nearshore marine fish important for recreational fisheries in the eastern North Pacific Ocean. Juvenile cabezon were maintained as either fed (6% mass food.g fish wet mass(-1).d(-1)) or fasted for 14 d. Fasted fish exhibited a lower body condition (K), a depressed mass-specific growth rate (SGR), and reduced plasma concentrations of Igf1. In the liver, fasting reduced the relative abundance of gene transcripts encoding Igfbps igfbp2a and igfbp2b, while significantly elevating mRNA levels for igfbp1a, igfbp1b, igfbp3b, and igfbp4. Fasting also reduced hepatic mRNA levels of GH receptor-1 (ghr1) - but not GH receptor-2 (ghr2) - supporting the idea that changes in liver sensitivity to GH may underlie the decline in plasma Igf1 during food deprivation. In skeletal muscle, fasting downregulated gene transcripts encoding igf1, igfbp2b, igfbp5b, and igfbp6b, while also upregulating mRNAs for igf2 and ghr2. These data demonstrate isoform-specific regulation of Igfbps in liver and skeletal muscle in cabezon experiencing food deprivation and reinforce the idea that the repertoire of duplicated Igfbp genes that evolved in actinopterygian fishes supports a diverse scope of endocrine and paracrine functions.","[Strobel, Jackson S.; Hack, Nicole L.; Label, Kevin T.; Cordova, Kasey L.; Bersin, Theresa, V; Lema, Sean C.] Calif Polytech State Univ San Luis Obispo, Ctr Coastal Marine Sci, Biol Sci Dept, San Luis Obispo, CA 93407 USA; [Journey, Meredith L.] Lynker Technol, 202 Church St SE 536, Leesburg, VA 20175 USA; [Journey, Meredith L.; Beckman, Brian R.] NOAA, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Northwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Environm & Fisheries Sci Div, Seattle, WA 98112 USA; [Hack, Nicole L.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA","California State University System; California Polytechnic State University San Luis Obispo; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of California System; University of California Santa Cruz","Lema, SC (corresponding author), Calif Polytech State Univ San Luis Obispo, Ctr Coastal Marine Sci, Biol Sci Dept, San Luis Obispo, CA 93407 USA.","slema@calpoly.edu","Beckman, Brian/HSH-8935-2023","Lema, Sean/0000-0002-2564-8992","California Sea Grant [R/HCME-15]; William and Linda Frost Fund in the Cal Poly College of Science and Mathematics; California State University's (CSU) Council on Ocean Affairs, Science & Technology (COAST); California Polytechnic State University (Cal Poly); COAST Undergraduate Research Award","California Sea Grant; William and Linda Frost Fund in the Cal Poly College of Science and Mathematics; California State University's (CSU) Council on Ocean Affairs, Science & Technology (COAST); California Polytechnic State University (Cal Poly); COAST Undergraduate Research Award","This research funded by California Sea Grant (R/HCME-15), and by generous support from the William and Linda Frost Fund in the Cal Poly College of Science and Mathematics to J.

Spatiotemporally explicit perspectives of rivers and their biota nested within the socio-ecological landscape now provide guiding principles and approaches in inland fisheries and watershed management. During the last two decades, scientific literature on riverscapes has increased rapidly, indicating that the term and associated approaches are serving an important purpose in freshwater science and management. We trace the origins and theoretical foundations of riverscape perspectives and approaches and examine trends in the published literature to assess the state of the science and demonstrate how they are being applied to address recent challenges in the management of riverine ecosystems. We focus on approaches for studying and visualizing rivers and streams with remote sensing, modelling and sampling designs that enable pattern detection as seen from above (e.g. river channel, floodplain, and riparian areas) but also into the water itself (e.g. aquatic organisms and the aqueous environment). Key concepts from landscape ecology that are central to riverscape approaches are heterogeneity, scale (resolution, extent and scope) and connectivity (structural and functional), which underpin spatial and temporal aspects of study design, data collection and analysis. Mapping of physical and biological characteristics of rivers and floodplains with high-resolution, spatially intensive techniques improves understanding of the causes and ecological consequences of spatial patterns at multiple scales. This information is crucial for managing river ecosystems, especially for the successful implementation of conservation, restoration and monitoring programs. Recent advances in remote sensing, field-sampling approaches and geospatial technology are making it increasingly feasible to collect high-resolution data over larger scales in space and time. We highlight challenges and opportunities and discuss future avenues of research with emerging tools that can potentially help to overcome obstacles to collecting, analysing and displaying these data. This synthesis is intended to help researchers and resource managers understand and apply these concepts and approaches to address real-world problems in freshwater management.","[Torgersen, Christian E.] Univ Washington, US Geol Survey, Forest & Rangeland Ecosyst Sci Ctr, Cascadia Field Stn,Sch Environm & Forest Sci, Box 352100, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Le Pichon, Celine; Tales, Evelyne; Belliard, Jerome] Univ Paris Saclay, INRAE, HYCAR, 1 Rue Pierre Gilles de Gennes,CS 10030, F-92761 Antony, France; [Fullerton, Aimee H.] NOAA, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Northwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Fish Ecol Div, 2725 Montlake Blvd E, Seattle, WA 98112 USA; [Dugdale, Stephen J.] Univ Nottingham, Sch Geog, Univ Pk, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England; [Duda, Jeffrey J.] US Geol Survey, Western Fisheries Res Ctr, 6505 NE 65th St, Seattle, WA 98115 USA; [Giovannini, Floriane] INRAE, DipSO Directorate Open Sci, 1 Rue Pierre Gilles Gennes,CS 10030, F-92761 Antony, France; [Branco, Paulo] Univ Lisbon, Inst Super Agron, Ctr Estudos Florestais, P-1349017 Lisbon, Portugal; [Bergeron, Normand E.] Inst Natl Rech Sci, Ctr Eau Terre Environm, 490 Rue Couronne, Quebec City, PQ G1K 9A9, Canada; [Roy, Mathieu L.] Environm & Climate Change Canada, 1550 Ave Estimauville, Quebec City, PQ G1J 0C3, Canada; [Tonolla, Diego] Zurich Univ Appl Sci, Inst Nat Resource Sci, CH-8820 Wadenswil, Switzerland; [Lamouroux, Nicolas; Capra, Herve] INRAE, RiverLy, 5 Rue Doua,CS 20244, F-69625 Villeurbanne, France; [Baxter, Colden V.] Idaho State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Stream Ecol Ctr, Pocatello, ID 83209 USA","University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; Universite Paris Saclay; INRAE; Universite Paris Cite; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of Nottingham; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; INRAE; Universidade de Lisboa; Centro de Estudos Florestais; University of Quebec; Institut national de la recherche scientifique (INRS); Environment & Climate Change Canada; Zurich University of Applied Sciences; INRAE; Idaho State University","Torgersen, CE (corresponding author), Univ Washington, US Geol Survey, Forest & Rangeland Ecosyst Sci Ctr, Cascadia Field Stn,Sch Environm & Forest Sci, Box 352100, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.;Le Pichon, C (corresponding author), Univ Paris Saclay, INRAE, HYCAR, 1 Rue Pierre Gilles de Gennes,CS 10030, F-92761 Antony, France.","ctorgersen@usgs.gov; celine.lepichon@inrae.fr","Tales, Evelyne/KFQ-5045-2024; Dugdale, Stephen/K-4251-2015; Branco, Paulo/B-6854-2012; Duda, Jeffrey/A-7132-2009","Giovannini, Floriane/0000-0002-2804-5716; Dugdale, Stephen/0000-0003-3561-4216; Le Pichon, Celine/0000-0001-8055-7164; Fullerton, Aimee/0000-0002-5581-3434; Tales, Evelyne/0000-0001-8811-6830; Branco, Paulo/0000-0002-2502-5533; Duda, Jeffrey/0000-0001-7431-8634","INRAE; FCT-Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia, I.P., under 'Norma Transitoria' [DL 57/2016/CP1382/CT0020]; Fundao para a Cincia e a Tecnologia [DL 57/2016/CP1382/CT0020] Funding Source: FCT","INRAE; FCT-Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia, I.P., under 'Norma Transitoria'; Fundao para a Cincia e a Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT))","We thank the 51 participants who answered an informal questionnaire in May 2016 about riverscape approaches, providing insightful thoughts for this review.

In fact, 200 miles of the mainstem HR is designated a U.S. federal Superfund site, the largest in the nation, because of PCB contamination. The tidal HR hosts the southernmost spawning population of Atlantic tomcod, Microgadus tomcod, and studies revealed a correlation between exposure of juveniles to warm water temperature during summer to abundance of spawning adults of the same cohort in the following winter. Further, a battery of mechanistically linked biomarkers, ranging from the molecular to the population levels, were significantly impacted from contaminant exposures of the HR tomcod population. In response to xenobiotic insult, the HR tomcod population developed resistance to PCB and TCDD toxicity resulting from a deletion in the aryl hydrocarbon receptor2 (AHR2) gene. Furthermore, RNA-Seq analysis of global gene expression demonstrated that effects of the AHR2 polymorphism were far more pervasive than anticipated. The most highly PCB-contaminated sediments in the upper HR were dredged between 2009 and 2015 with the objective of lowering PCB concentrations in fishes in the lower HR. Success of the remediation project has been controversial. These observations suggest that tomcod provides an informative model to evaluate the efficacy of HR PCB remediation efforts on downriver fish populations and possible interactive effects between contaminant exposure and a warming environment.","[Wirgin, Isaac; Roy, Nirmal K.] New York Univ, Dept Environm Med, Sch Med, New York, NY 10012 USA; [Chambers, R.

However, selection in the wild depends on ecological context, including features of predator and prey populations, making field studies of selection critical to understanding how predators shape selection on prey defences. Threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) is a classic system to study the effects of predators on the natural selection of prey. In lakes and rivers, fish predators have been shown to impose selection against low plated adult stickleback phenotypes and genotypes. We directly measured selection by predatory salmonids on the Ectodysplasin-A (Eda) gene in estuary stickleback from California. Despite previous studies showing a positive correlation between predator presence and frequency of the Eda complete allele in estuary populations, we found that Eda low genotypes were not significantly more frequent in salmonid predator diets. Further, we found no evidence of changes in Eda genotype frequencies across generations that would suggest directional selection driven by predators. Prior selection studies have examined the effects of large resident trout on adult stickleback. In contrast, predators in this study were juvenile anadromous salmonids, which only ate juvenile stickleback whose plate phenotypes had not fully developed. Thus, in this case, predator life history and stickleback ontogeny may preclude strong selection on stickleback armour. Our results underscore the importance of selection studies in the wild for understanding the context-dependent nature of selection in natural populations.","[Wasserman, Ben A.; Reid, Kerry; Arredondo, Olivia M.; Palkovacs, Eric P.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Osterback, Ann-Marie K.; Kern, Cynthia H.; Kiernan, Joseph D.; Palkovacs, Eric P.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Inst Marine Sci, Fisheries Collaborat Program, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Osterback, Ann-Marie K.; Kern, Cynthia H.; Kiernan, Joseph D.] NOAA, Southwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Fisheries Ecol Div, Santa Cruz, CA USA; [Reid, Kerry] Univ Hong Kong, Sch Biol Sci, Div Ecol & Biodivers, Fac Sci, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Arredondo, Olivia M.] Artemis Environm Serv Inc, Stanton, CA USA","University of California System; University of California Santa Cruz; University of California System; University of California Santa Cruz; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of Hong Kong","Wasserman, B (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Cruz, 130 McAllister Way,Coastal Biol Bldg, Santa Cruz, CA 95060 USA.","ben.a.wasserman@gmail.com","Wasserman, Ben/IAM-1481-2023; Kiernan, Joseph/S-3613-2019","Wasserman, Ben/0000-0002-9997-4934","Cooperative Insistute for Marine Ecosystems and Climate; Mildred E.

Here, we evaluated genetic population structure in lingcod (Ophiodon elongatus), a commercially and recreationally important fishery species along the west coast of North America. We used 16,749 restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (RADseq) markers, in 611 individuals collected from across the bulk of the species range from Southeast Alaska to Baja California, Mexico. In contrast to previous population genetic work on this species, we found strong evidence for two distinct genetic clusters. These groups separated latitudinally with a break near Point Reyes off Northern California, and there was a high frequency of admixed individuals in close proximity to the break. F-statistics corroborate this genetic break between northern and southern sampling sites, although most loci are characterized by low F(ST)values, suggesting high gene flow throughout most of the genome. Outlier analyses identified 182 loci putatively under divergent selection, most of which mapped to a single genomic region. When individuals were grouped by cluster assignment (northern, southern, and admixed), 71 loci were fixed between the northern and southern cluster, all of which were identified in the outlier scans. All individuals identified as admixed exhibited near 50:50 assignment to northern and southern clusters and were heterozygous for most fixed loci. Alignments of RADseq loci to a draft lingcod genome assembly and three other teleost genomes with chromosome-level assemblies suggest that outlier and fixed loci are concentrated on a single chromosome. Similar genomic patterns have been attributed to chromosomal inversions in diverse taxonomic groups. Regardless of the evolutionary mechanism, these results represent novel observations of genetic structure in lingcod and designate clear evolutionary units that could be used to inform fisheries management.","[Longo, Gary C.] NOAA, NRC Res Associateship Program, Northwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Seattle, WA USA; [Lam, Laurel; Williams, Greg] NOAA, Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commiss, Northwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Seattle, WA USA; [Lam, Laurel; Basnett, Bonnie; Hamilton, Scott] Moss Landing Marine Labs, Pob 450, Moss Landing, CA 95039 USA; [Samhouri, Jameal; Andrews, Kelly; Nichols, Krista M.] NOAA, Conservat Biol Div, Northwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, 2725 Montlake Blvd E, Seattle, WA 98112 USA; [Goetz, Giles] NOAA, UWJISAO, Northwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Seattle, WA USA; [McClure, Michelle] NOAA, Fisheries Resource Anal & Monitoring Div, Northwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Seattle, WA USA; [McClure, Michelle] NOAA, Pacific Marine Environm Lab, 7600 Sand Point Way Ne, Seattle, WA 98115 USA","National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Moss Landing Marine Laboratories; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA","Longo, GC (corresponding author), NOAA, Conservat Biol Div, Northwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, 2725 Montlake Blvd E, Seattle, WA 98112 USA.","garycharleslongo@gmail.com","McClure, Michelle/O-7853-2015","Longo, Gary/0000-0002-4282-9111","NMFS Habitat Assessment Improvement Plan (HAIP) [NA15-NMF4550353]","NMFS Habitat Assessment Improvement Plan (HAIP)","NMFS Habitat Assessment Improvement Plan (HAIP), Grant/Award Number: #NA15-NMF4550353",NA,110,22,25,0,17,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","1752-4571","","","EVOL APPL","Evol.

Genetic sexing and development of sex markers are crucial for the early identification of sex and of particular genotypes (YY males) for the production of all-male population in channel catfish aquaculture. In this study, we sequenced genomic DNA from pools of males and pools of females to better characterize the sex determining region (SDR) of channel catfish and to develop sex-specific markers for genetic sexing. Performing comparative analyses on male and female pooled genomic reads, we identified a large SDR (-8.3 Mb) in the middle of channel catfish linkage group 4 (LG04). This non-recombining SDR contains a high-density of male -specific (Y chromosome) fixed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) along with -185 kb male-specific in-sertions or deletions. This SDR contains 95 annotated protein-encoding genes, including the recently reported putative channel catfish master sex determining (MSD) gene, breast cancer anti-estrogen resistance protein 1 (bcar1), located at one edge of the SDR. No sex-specific SNPs and/or indels were found in the coding sequence of bcar1, but one male-specific SNP was identified in its first intron. Based on this genomic information, we developed a PCR-based sex-specific genetic test. Genotyping results confirmed strong linkage between pheno-typic sexes and the identified SDR in channel catfish. Our results confirm, using a Pool-Seq approach, that channel catfish is male heterogametic (XX-XY) with a large SDR on the LG04 sex chromosome. Furthermore, our genotyping primers can be used to identify XX, XY, and YY fish that will facilitate future research on sex determination and aquaculture applications in channel catfish.","[Wen, Ming] Hunan Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci, State Key Lab Dev Biol Freshwater Fish, Changsha 35000, Peoples R China; [Wen, Ming; Pan, Qiaowei; Guiguen, Yann] INRAE, LPGP, F-35000 Rennes, France; [Pan, Qiaowei] Univ Lausanne, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Lausanne, Switzerland; [Larson, Wes] Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, NOAA, Alaska Fisheries Sci Ctr, Auke Bay Labs, 17109 Point Lena Loop Rd, Juneau, AK 99801 USA; [Eche, Camille] INRAE, GeT PlaGe, Castanet Tolosan, France","Hunan Normal University; INRAE; University of Lausanne; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); INRAE","Wen, M (corresponding author), Hunan Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci, State Key Lab Dev Biol Freshwater Fish, Changsha 35000, Peoples R China.;Guiguen, Y (corresponding author), INRAE, Lab Physiol & Genom Poissons LPGP, Campus Beaulieu,Batiment 16A, F-35042 Rennes, France.","ming.wen@hunnu.edn.cn; yann.guiguen@inrae.fr","","","Agence Nationale de la Recherche (PhyloSex project) [ANR-13-ISV7-0005]; France Genomique National infrastructure as part of Investissement d'avenir program [ANR-10-INBS-09]; Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR) [ANR-13-ISV7-0005] Funding Source: Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)","Agence Nationale de la Recherche (PhyloSex project)(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)); France Genomique National infrastructure as part of Investissement d'avenir program(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)); Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR))","This project was supported by funds from the Agence Nationale de la Recherche (PhyloSex project, grant No. ANR-13-ISV7-0005).

Spinner dolphins in the eastern tropical Pacific (ETP) present a unique system for studying adaptation. Within this large geographical region are four spinner dolphin ecotypes with weak neutral genetic divergence and no obvious barriers to gene flow, but strong spatial variation in morphology, behaviour and habitat. These ecotypes have large population sizes, which could reduce the effects of drift and facilitate selection. To identify genomic regions putatively under divergent selective pressures between ecotypes, we used genome scans with 8994 RADseq single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to identify population differentiation outliers and genotype-environment association outliers. Gene ontology enrichment analyses indicated that outlier SNPs from both types of analyses were associated with multiple genes involved in social behaviour and hippocampus development, including 15 genes associated with the human social disorder autism. Evidence for divergent selection on social behaviour is supported by previous evidence that these spinner dolphin ecotypes differ in mating systems and associated social behaviours. In particular, three of the ETP ecotypes probably have a polygynous mating system characterized by strong premating competition among males, whereas the fourth ecotype probably has a polygynandrous mating system characterized by strong postmating competition such as sperm competition. Our results provide evidence that selection for social behaviour may be an evolutionary force driving diversification of spinner dolphins in the ETP, potentially as a result of divergent sexual selection associated with different mating systems. Future studies should further investigate the potential adaptive role of the candidate genes identified here, and could probably find further signatures of selection using whole genome sequence data.","[Andrews, Kimberly R.; Hoelzel, A.

During recent cruises along the East Pacific, many deep-sea squat lobsters were collected. Among these, we described five new munidopsid species supported both by morphological characters and molecular phylogenetics: Munidopsis girguisi sp. nov., M. nautilus sp. nov., M. testuda sp. nov., M. cortesi sp. nov. and M. hendrickxi sp. nov. We also report new records of several Munidopsis species across the East Pacific that increase the species distribution ranges. Here, we reconstructed the phylogenetic relationships of the East Pacific species in relation to other Galatheoidea using one nuclear and two mitochondrial gene fragment(s); we also performed single locus species delimitation analyses to explore the species status of various East Pacific munidopsid taxa. The new taxa were photographed, illustrated and imaged with micro-computed tomography. The phylogenetic results show that: (1) Janetogalathea californiensis, previously included in the family Galatheidae, nests within Munidopsidae; (2) the phylogenetic position of Phylladiorhynchus and Coralliogalathea as belonging in Galatheidae is not supported; and (3) Munidopsis is paraphyletic, agreeing with recent systematic hypotheses. Short genetic distances and species delimitation analyses suggested that a clade mostly constituted by abyssal species might include fewer species than currently considered, as species show a wider geographic range than previously considered, conforming with traditional hypotheses of cosmopolitanisms in abyssal species.ZooBank: urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:CED9EB18-7061-47A7-B2FF-7F1DAFCC7B12.","[Rodriguez-Flores, Paula C.; Giribet, Gonzalo] Harvard Univ, Dept Organism & Evolutionary Biol, Museum Comparat Zool, 26 Oxford St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Seid, Charlotte A.; Rouse, Greg W.] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA","Harvard University; University of California System; University of California San Diego; Scripps Institution of Oceanography","Rodrguez-Flores, PC (corresponding author), Harvard Univ, Dept Organism & Evolutionary Biol, Museum Comparat Zool, 26 Oxford St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.","paularodriguezflores@g.harvard.edu","Rouse, Gregory/AAW-1494-2021; Seid, Charlotte/AAM-3992-2020; Rouse, Greg/F-2611-2010; Giribet, Gonzalo/P-1086-2015","Rouse, Greg/0000-0001-9036-9263; Seid, Charlotte/0000-0002-5307-691X; Giribet, Gonzalo/0000-0002-5467-8429","E.

Passive acoustic data can support the estimation of common, individual-level ecological metrics, such as presence, detection-weighted occupancy, abundance and density, population viability and structure, and behaviour. Passive acoustic data also can support estimation of some community-level metrics, such as species richness and composition. The feasibility of estimation and certainty of estimates is highly context dependent, and understanding the factors that affect the reliability of measurements is useful for those considering whether to use passive acoustic data. Here, we review basic concepts and methods of passive acoustic sampling in marine systems that often are applicable to marine mammal research and conservation. Our ultimate aim is to facilitate collaboration among ecologists, bioacousticians, and data analysts.Ecological applications of passive acoustics require one to make decisions about sampling design, which in turn requires consideration of sound propagation, sampling of signals, and data storage. One also must make decisions about signal detection and classification and evaluation of the performance of algorithms for these tasks. Investment in the research and development of systems that automate detection and classification, including machine learning, are increasing.Passive acoustic monitoring is more reliable for detection of species presence than for estimation of other species-level metrics. Use of passive acoustic monitoring to distinguish among individual animals remains difficult. However, information about detection probability, vocalisation or cue rate, and relations between vocalisations and the number and behaviour of animals increases the feasibility of estimating abundance or density. Most sensor deployments are fixed in space or are sporadic, making temporal turnover in species composition more tractable to estimate than spatial turnover. Collaborations between acousticians and ecologists are most likely to be successful and rewarding when all partners critically examine and share a fundamental understanding of the target variables, sampling process, and analytical methods.","[Fleishman, Erica] Oregon State Univ, Coll Earth Ocean Atmospher Sci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Cholewiak, Danielle] NOAA, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Northeast Fisheries Sci Ctr, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; [Gillespie, Douglas] Univ St Andrews, Scottish Oceans Inst, Sea Mammal Res Unit, St Andrews KY16 9XL, Fife, Scotland; [Helble, Tyler] Naval Informat Warfare Ctr Pacific, San Diego, CA 92152 USA; [Klinck, Holger] Cornell Univ, K Lisa Yang Ctr Conservat Bioacoust, Cornell Lab Ornithol, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA; [Nosal, Eva-Marie] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Ocean & Resources Engn, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Roch, Marie A.] San Diego State Univ, Dept Comp Sci, San Diego, CA 92182 USA","Oregon State University; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of St Andrews; Naval Information Warfare Center Pacific; Cornell University; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; California State University System; San Diego State University","Fleishman, E (corresponding author), Oregon State Univ, Coll Earth Ocean Atmospher Sci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.","erica.fleishman@oregonstate.edu","Nosal, Eva/AAA-2764-2020; Klinck, Holger/X-5214-2019; Roch, Marie/KGL-8020-2024","Nosal, Eva-Marie/0000-0001-5072-8372; Gillespie, Douglas/0000-0001-9628-157X","U.S. Office of Naval Research [N00014-17-1-2867]","U.S. Office of Naval Research(United States Department of DefenseUnited States NavyOffice of Naval Research)","ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS We thank Craig George for sharing the history of passive acoustic detection of bowhead whales in northern Alaska.

Because giant clams possess distinctive ectosymbiotic features, they represent a unique and powerful model for comparing molecular pathways involved in (a) maintenance of symbiosis and (b) acquisition of thermotolerance among coral reef organisms. Herein, we explored the physiological and transcriptomic responses of the clam hosts and their photosynthetically active symbionts over a 65 day experiment in which clams were exposed to either normal or environmentally relevant elevated seawater temperatures. Additionally, we used metabarcoding data coupled with in situ sampling/survey data to explore the relative importance of holobiont adaptation (i.e., a symbiont community shift) versus acclimation (i.e., physiological changes at the molecular level) in the clams' responses to environmental change. We finally compared transcriptomic data to publicly available genomic datasets for Symbiodiniaceae dinoflagellates (both cultured and in hospite with the coral Pocillopora damicornis) to better tease apart the responses of both hosts and specific symbiont genotypes in this mutualistic association. Gene module preservation analysis revealed that the function of the symbionts' photosystem II was impaired at high temperature, and this response was also found across all holobionts and Symbiodiniaceae lineages examined. Similarly, epigenetic modulation appeared to be a key response mechanism for symbionts in hospite with giant clams exposed to high temperatures, and such modulation was able to distinguish thermotolerant from thermosensitive Cladocopium goreaui ecotypes; epigenetic processes may, then, represent a promising research avenue for those interested in coral reef conservation in this era of changing global climate.","[Monteiro, Homere J.

Traditionally, this species has been perceived as consisting of eastern and western populations, spawning respectively in the Mediterranean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico, with mixing occurring throughout the Atlantic. However, recent studies have challenged this assumption by revealing weak genetic differentiation and identifying a previously unknown spawning ground in the Slope Sea used by Atlantic bluefin tuna of uncertain origin. To further understand the current and past population structure and connectivity of Atlantic bluefin tuna, we have assembled a unique dataset including thousands of genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 500 larvae, young of the year and spawning adult samples covering the three spawning grounds and including individuals of other Thunnus species. Our analyses support two weakly differentiated but demographically connected ancestral populations that interbreed in the Slope Sea. Moreover, we also identified signatures of introgression from albacore (Thunnus alalunga) into the Atlantic bluefin tuna genome, exhibiting varied frequencies across spawning areas, indicating strong gene flow from the Mediterranean Sea towards the Slope Sea. We hypothesize that the observed genetic differentiation may be attributed to increased gene flow caused by a recent intensification of westward migration by the eastern population, which could have implications for the genetic diversity and conservation of western populations. Future conservation efforts should consider these findings to address potential genetic homogenization in the species.","[Diaz-Arce, Natalia; Rodriguez-Ezpeleta, Naiara] Basque Res & Technol Alliance BRTA, AZTI, Marine Res, Sukarrieta, Spain; [Gagnaire, Pierre-Alexandre] Univ Montpellier, ISEM, CNRS, EPHE,IRD, Montpellier, France; [Richardson, David E.] NOAA, Northeast Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Narragansett, RI USA; [Walter III, John F.] NOAA, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Southeast Fisheries Sci Ctr, Miami, FL USA; [Arnaud-Haond, Sophie; Fromentin, Jean-Marc] Univ Montpellier, IFREMER, CNRS, MARBEC,IRD, Sete, France; [Lutcavage, Molly] Univ Massachusetts, Large Pelag Res Ctr, Sch Environm, Gloucester, MA USA; [Addis, Piero] Univ Cagliari, Dept Life & Environm Sci, Cagliari, Italy; [Brophy, Deirdre] Atlantic Technol Univ ATU, Marine & Freshwater Res Ctr, Galway City, Ireland; [Alemany, Francisco] Int Commiss Conservat Atlantic Tunas, GBYP, Madrid, Spain; [Allman, Robert] Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Southeast Fisheries Sci Ctr, Panama City Lab, Panama City, FL USA; [Deguara, Simeon] AquaBio Tech Ltd, Cent Complex, Mosta, Malta; [Fraile, Igaratza; Goni, Nicolas; Arrizabalaga, Haritz] Basque Res & Technol Alliance BRTA, AZTI, Marine Res, Pasaia, Spain; [Hanke, Alex R.] Fisheries & Oceans Canada, St Andrews Biol Stn, St Andrews, NB, Canada; [Karakulak, F.

Variations in the PrP gene (PRNP) have been associated with CWD rate of infection and disease progression. We analysed 568 free-ranging white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) from 9 CWD-positive Michigan counties for PRNP polymorphisms. Sampling included 185 CWD-positive, 332 CWD non-detected, and an additional 51 CWD non-detected paired to CWD-positives by sex, age, and harvest location. We found 12 polymorphic sites of which 5 were non-synonymous and resulted in a change in amino acid composition. Thirteen haplotypes were predicted, of which 11 have previously been described. Using logistic regression, consistent with other studies, we found haplotypes C (OR = 0.488, 95% CI = 0.321-0.730, P < 0.001) and F (OR = 0.122, 95% CI = 0.007-0.612, P < 0.05) and diplotype BC (OR = 0.340, 95% CI = 0.154-0.709, P < 0.01) were less likely to be found in deer infected with CWD. As has also been documented in other studies, the presence of a serine at amino acid 96 was less likely to be found in deer infected with CWD (P < 0.001, OR = 0.360 and 95% CI = 0.227-0.556). Identification of PRNP polymorphisms associated with reduced vulnerability to CWD in Michigan deer and their spatial distribution can help managers design surveillance programmesand identify and prioritize areas for CWD management.","[Ott-Conn, Caitlin N.] Michigan Dept Nat Resources, Wildlife Dis Lab, 4125 Beaumont Rd Rm 250, Lansing, MI 48910 USA; [Blanchong, Julie A.] Iowa State Univ, Dept Nat Resource Ecol & Management, Ames, IA USA; [Larson, Wes A.] NOAA, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Alaska Fisheries Sci Ctr, Juneau, AK USA","Iowa State University; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)","Ott-Conn, CN (corresponding author), Michigan Dept Nat Resources, Wildlife Dis Lab, 4125 Beaumont Rd Rm 250, Lansing, MI 48910 USA.","OttConnC@michigan.gov","","Ott-Conn, Caitlin/0000-0002-8231-3785","Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service [14831]","Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service","This work was supported by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service [14831].",NA,45,0,0,0,6,"TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC","PHILADELPHIA","530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA","1933-6896","1933-690X","","PRION","Prion","JAN 1",2021,15,"1",NA,"","","",183,190,"","10.1080/19336896.2021.1990628","http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/19336896.2021.1990628",NA,"",8,"Biochemistry & Molecular Biology","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Biochemistry & Molecular Biology","WT8UV",34751633,"Green Published, gold","","","2024-10-25","WOS:000716135100001","View Full Record in Web of Science",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, only a few phylogenetic relationships have reached acceptance because of strong gene-tree species tree discordance. Divergence times estimates in the group also vary largely between studies. These uncertainties impeded the understanding of the biogeographical history of the group, such as when and how trans-equatorial dispersal and subsequent speciation events occurred. Here, we used high-coverage genome-wide sequencing for 14 of the 15 species of Otariidae to elucidate the phylogeny of the family and its bearing on the taxonomy and biogeographical history. Despite extreme topological discordance among gene trees, we found a fully supported species tree that agrees with the few well-accepted relationships and establishes monophyly of the genus Arctocephalus. Our data support a relatively recent trans-hemispheric dispersal at the base of a southern lade, which rapidly diversified into six major lineages between 3 and 2.5 Ma. Otaria diverged first, followed by Phocarctos and then four major lineages within Arctocephalus. However, we found Zalophus to be nonmonophyletic, with California (Zalophus californianus) and Steller sea lions (Eumetopias jubatus) grouping closer than the Galapagos sea lion (Zalophus wollebaeki) with evidence for introgression between the two genera. Overall, the high degree of genealogical discordance was best explained by incomplete lineage sorting resulting from quasi-simultaneous speciation within the southern Glade with introgresssion playing a subordinate role in explaining the incongruence among and within prior phylogenetic studies of the family.","[Lopes, Fernando; Kessler, Amanda; Beux, Yago; Bonatto, Sandro L.] Pontificia Univ Cutol Rio Grande do Sul, Escola Ciencias Saude & Vida, BR-90619900 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; [Lopes, Fernando; Oliveira, Larissa R.] Univ Vale Rio dos Sinos, Lab Ecol Mamiferos, Sao Leopoldo, RS, Brazil; [Oliveira, Larissa R.] Grp Estudos Mamiferos Aquat Rio Grande do Sul, GEMARS, BR-95560000 Torres, RS, Brazil; [Crespo, Enrique] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Ctr Nacl Patagon CENPAT, Puerto Madryn, Argentina; [Cardenas-Alayza, Susana; Majluf, Patricia] Univ Peruana Cayetano Heredia, Ctr Sostenibilidad Ambiental, Lima, Peru; [Sepulveda, Maritza] Univ Valparaiso, Fac Ciencias, Ctr Invest & Gest Recursos Nat CIGREN, Valparaiso, Chile; [Brownell, Robert L., Jr.] NOAA, Southwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, La Jolla, CA USA; [Franco-Trecu, Valentina] Univ Republica, Fac Ciencias, Dept Ecol & Evoluc, Montevideo, Uruguay; [Paez-Rosas, Diego; Chaves, Jaime] Univ Sun Francisco Quito, COCIBA, Colegio Gen Biol & Ambientales, Quito, Ecuador; [Chaves, Jaime] San Francisco State Univ, Dept Biol, 1800 Holloway Ave, San Francisco, CA 94132 USA; [Loch, Carolina] Univ Otago, Fac Dent, Sir John Wu & Ch Res Inst, Dunedin, New Zealand; [Robertson, Bruce C.] Univ Otago, Dept Zool, Dunedin, New Zealand; [Acevedo-Whitehouse, Karina] Univ Hiaoma Queretaro, Sch Nat Sci, Unit Basic & Appl Microbiol, Queretaro, Mexico; [Elorriaga-Verplancken, Fernando R.] Ctr Interdisciplinario Ciencias Marinas, Inst Politecn Nacl, La Paz, Mexico; [Kirkman, Stephen P.] Dept Environm Affairs Oceans & Coasts, Cape Town, South Africa; [Peart, Claire R.; Wolf, Jochen B.

Achieving this goal requires a complex intersection of science and management, and a recognition of the interconnections among people, place, and fish that govern these tightly coupled socioecological and sociotechnical systems. The World Fisheries Congress (WFC) convenes every four years and provides a unique global forum to debate and discuss threats, issues, and opportunities facing fish populations and fisheries. The 2021 WFC meeting, hosted remotely in Adelaide, Australia, marked the 30th year since the first meeting was held in Athens, Greece, and provided an opportunity to reflect on progress made in the past 30 years and provide guidance for the future. We assembled a diverse team of individuals involved with the Adelaide WFC and reflected on the major challenges that faced fish and fisheries over the past 30 years, discussed progress toward overcoming those challenges, and then used themes that emerged during the Congress to identify issues and opportunities to improve sustainability in the world's fisheries for the next 30 years. Key future needs and opportunities identified include: rethinking fisheries management systems and modelling approaches, modernizing and integrating assessment and information systems, being responsive and flexible in addressing persistent and emerging threats to fish and fisheries, mainstreaming the human dimension of fisheries, rethinking governance, policy and compliance, and achieving equity and inclusion in fisheries. We also identified a number of cross-cutting themes including better understanding the role of fish as nutrition in a hungry world, adapting to climate change, embracing transdisciplinarity, respecting Indigenous knowledge systems, thinking ahead with foresight science, and working together across scales. By reflecting on the past and thinking about the future, we aim to provide guidance for achieving our mutual goal of sustaining vibrant fish populations and sustainable fisheries that benefit all. We hope that this prospective thinking can serve as a guide to (i) assess progress towards achieving this lofty goal and (ii) refine our path with input from new and emerging voices and approaches in fisheries science, management, and stewardship.","[Cooke, Steven J.; Nyboer, Elizabeth] Carleton Univ, Dept Biol, Fish Ecol & Conservat Physiol Lab, 1125 Colonel Dr, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada; [Cooke, Steven J.; Nyboer, Elizabeth] Carleton Univ, Inst Environm & Interdisciplinary Sci, 1125 Colonel Dr, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada; [Fulton, Elizabeth A.; Preece, Ann L.] CSIRO Environm, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia; [Fulton, Elizabeth A.; Kelly, Rachel] Univ Tasmania, Ctr Marine Socioecol, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia; [Sauer, Warwick H.

However, a paucity of longitudinal genomic datasets has impeded understanding of how these rapid selection events alter cryptic genetic structure. Heatwave impacts may be exacerbated in species that engage in obligate symbioses, where the genetics of multiple coevolving taxa may be affected. Here, we tracked the symbiotic associations of reef-building corals for 6 years through a prolonged heatwave, including known survivorship for 79 of 315 colonies. Coral genetics strongly predicted survival of the ubiquitous coral, Porites (massive growth form), with variable survival (15 to 61%) across three morphologically indistinguishable-but genetically distinct-lineages. The heatwave also disrupted strong associations between these coral lineages and their algal symbionts (family Symbiodiniaceae), with symbiotic turnover in some colonies, resulting in reduced specificity across lineages. These results highlight how heatwaves can threaten cryptic genotypes and decouple otherwise tightly coevolved relationships between hosts and symbionts.","[Starko, Samuel; Claar, Danielle C.; Baum, Julia K.] Univ Victoria, Dept Biol, POB 1700 Stn CSC, Victoria, BC V8W 2Y2, Canada;

The present study sought to optimize an in vitro test system using pituitary cells isolated from previtellogenic female coho salmon and rainbow trout, focusing on fshb and lhb subunit gene expression. Initially, we optimized culture conditions for duration and benefits of culturing with and without addition of endogenous sex steroids (17 beta-estradiol [E2] or 11-ketotestosterone) or gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). The results suggest that culturing with and without E2 was valuable because it could mimic the (+) feedback effects on Lh that are observed from in vivo studies. After optimizing assay conditions, a suite of 12 contaminants and other hormones was evaluated for their effects on fshb and lhb gene expression. Each chemical was tested at four to five different concentrations up to solubility limitations in cell culture media. The results indicate that more chemicals alter lhb synthesis than fshb. The more potent chemicals were estrogens (E2 and 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol) and the aromatizable androgen testosterone, which induced lhb. The estrogen antagonists 4-OH-tamoxifen and prochloraz decreased the E2-stimulated expression of lhb. Among several selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors tested, the sertraline metabolite norsertraline was notable for both increasing fshb synthesis and decreasing the E2 stimulation of lhb. These results indicate that diverse types of chemicals can alter gonadotropin production in fish. Furthermore, we have shown that pituitary cell culture is useful for screening chemicals with potential endocrine-disrupting activity and can support the development of quantitative adverse outcome pathways in fish.

Consistent monitoring of coastal areas provides critical environmental assessment data. Sediments and Eastern Oyster (Crassostrea virginica) tissues were collected at fourteen South Carolina (SC) and four North Carolina (NC) sites as part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Mussel Watch environmental monitoring program. Cellular and molecular techniques were employed to measure C. virginica stress response, specifically, Lipid Peroxidation (LPx), Glutathione (GSH), and qPCR techniques. Gene specific primers targeted for detecting oxidative stress and cellular death were developed in C. virginica to gauge response to current environmental conditions using gill and hepatopancreas (HP) tissue. In order to validate gene specific markers as additional assessment tools, a 96 h zinc (Zn) laboratory exposure was performed. Cellular biomarker data revealed tissue specific responses. Hepatopancreas data showed C. virginica exhibited stress through the lipid peroxidation assay amongst sampling sites, however, response was managed through glutathione detoxification. Gill tissue data had significantly lower levels of cellular biomarker response compared to hepatopancreas. Molecular biomarkers targeting these cellular stress pathways through qPCR analysis show upregulation of Metallothionein in hepatopancreas and gill tissue with a concurrent > 2-fold upregulation in the detoxification marker Superoxide Dismutase (SOD) at three NC sites. SC sites displayed higher stress levels through LPx assays and down-regulation in GPx gene activity. Laboratory zinc exposure revealed no significance in cellular biomarker results, however, molecular data showed gills responding to zinc treatment through upregulation of Metallothionein, SOD and Cathepsin L, indicating an acute response in gills. Collectively, chemical, cellular and molecular methods clarify sentinel stress response of biological impacts and aid in evaluating environmental health in coastal ecosystems. This combined methodological approach provides a detailed analysis of environmental conditions and improves land-use management decisions.","[Aquilina-Beck, Alisan; Rider, Mary; Burdine, William] NOAA, JHT Inc, Natl Ctr Coastal Ocean Sci, Natl Ocean Serv,CSS Inc, Charleston, SC 29412 USA; [Reed, Lou Ann; Daugomah, James; Apeti, Dennis; Key, Pete] NOAA, Natl Ocean Serv, Natl Ctr Coastal Ocean Sci, Charleston, SC USA; [Aquilina-Beck, Alisan] NOAA, Natl Ctr Coastal Ocean Sci, Natl Ocean Serv, CSS,Ecotoxicol Branch, 331 Ft Johnson Rd, Charleston, SC 29412 USA","National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; National Ocean Service, NOAA; National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science (NOOCS); National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; National Ocean Service, NOAA; National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science (NOOCS); National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; National Ocean Service, NOAA; National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science (NOOCS)","Aquilina-Beck, A (corresponding author), NOAA, Natl Ctr Coastal Ocean Sci, Natl Ocean Serv, CSS,Ecotoxicol Branch, 331 Ft Johnson Rd, Charleston, SC 29412 USA.","allisan.beck@noaa.gov","","","US Department of the Interior, United States; National Park Service [P20PG00222]","US Department of the Interior, United States; National Park Service","This research was funded in part by the US Department of the Interior, United States; National Park Service (Grant Number# P20PG00222) for work conducted in CALO, NC",NA,53,0,0,0,8,"ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE","SAN DIEGO","525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA","0013-9351","1096-0953","","ENVIRON RES","Environ.

In contrast, S1 anadromous males outcompeted S2 males for access to nesting females and, as a result, produced significantly more offspring. Male dominance was positively associated with body mass, but body mass did not account for differences between S1 and S2 males. Much smaller precocious S2 males that matured during rearing in hatchery raceways sired offspring in all six breeding groups. Contributions from precocious males were nearly always the result of sneak spawning events, although on rare occasions, precocious males were able to stimulate females to spawn in the absence of an anadromous male.

The optimal age at maturity can vary by sex, and the ability of each sex to evolve towards its fitness optimum depends on the genetic architecture of maturation. Using GWAS of RAD sequencing data, we show that age at maturity in Chinook salmon exhibits sex-specific genetic architecture, with age at maturity in males influenced by large (up to 20 Mb) male-specific haplotypes. These regions showed no such effect in females. We also provide evidence for translocation of the sex-determining gene between two different chromosomes. This has important implications for sexually antagonistic selection, particularly that sex linkage of adaptive genes may differ within and among populations based on chromosomal location of the sex-determining gene. Our findings will facilitate research into the genetic causes of shifting demography in Chinook salmon as well as a better understanding of sex determination in this species and Pacific salmon in general.","[McKinney, Garrett J.] NOAA, NRC Res Associateship Program, Conservat Biol Div, Northwest Fisheries Sci Ctr,Natl Marine Fisheries, Seattle, WA USA; [McKinney, Garrett J.; Nichols, Krista M.; Ford, Michael J.] NOAA, Conservat Biol Div, Northwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Seattle, WA USA","National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA","McKinney, GJ (corresponding author), NOAA, NRC Res Associateship Program, Northwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, 2725 Montlake Blvd E, Seattle, WA 98112 USA.","Garrett.Mckinney@noaa.gov","","","National Research Council","National Research Council","We would like to thank Andrew Murdoch, Michael Hughes and the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife for obtaining genetic samples and collecting phenotypic data, and Sharon Howard for preparing sequencing libraries.

Molecular biomarkers that allow age estimates from small tissue biopsies promise to enhance studies of long-lived whales, addressing a fundamental and challenging parameter in wildlife management. DNA methylation (DNAm) can affect gene expression, and strong correlations between DNAm patterns and age have been documented in humans and nonhuman vertebrates and used to construct epigenetic clocks. We present several epigenetic clocks for skin samples from two of the longest-lived cetaceans, killer whales and bowhead whales. Applying the mammalian methylation array to genomic DNA from skin samples we validate four different clocks with median errors of 2.3-3.7 years. These epigenetic clocks demonstrate the validity of using cytosine methylation data to estimate the age of long-lived cetaceans and have broad applications supporting the conservation and management of long-lived cetaceans using genomic DNA from remote tissue biopsies.","[Parsons, Kim M.; Hanson, M.

In principle, genetic rescue increases genetic variation in a population through translocation of unrelated individuals from an outside source population. Genetic rescue remains uncommon in conservation management due to concerns about the risk of outbreeding depression. Lack of data evaluating success of genetic rescue interventions has hampered willingness to use this technique to improve the genetic viability of inbred, bottlenecked populations. Here, we evaluate the success of a genetic rescue intervention within the endangered Central California Coast Coho Salmon Evolutionarily Significant Unit using similar to 17 years of genetic and demographic data, including pre- and postoutcrossing with fish from a nearby watershed. We assessed fitness of outcrossed F1 and F2 progeny in a captive setting, and then used mark-recapture to estimate survival of juveniles released into streams. We found that outcrossing decreased relatedness among adults, and their hybrid progeny had higher fitness in both captive and stream settings relative to nonhybrids. Importantly, we did not observe evidence of outbreeding depression in either the F1 or F2 generations. This study highlights that genetic rescue can be a useful tool in the conservation of imperiled salmonids.","[Pregler, Kasey C. C.; Obedzinski, Mariska; Carlson, Stephanie M.

Here we provide the complete mitogenomes and the nuclear 18S and 28S ribosomal genes of twenty Octopoda specimens, comprising 18 species of Cirrata and Incirrata, representing 13 genera and all five putative families of Cirrata (Cirroctopodidae, Cirroteuthidae, Grimpoteuthidae, Opisthoteuthidae and Stauroteuthidae) and six families of Incirrata (Amphitretidae, Argonautidae, Bathypolypodidae, Eledonidae, Enteroctopodidae, and Mega-leledonidae) which were assembled using genome skimming. Phylogenetic trees were built using Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian Inference with several alignment matrices. All mitochondrial genomes had the 'typical' genome composition and gene order previously reported for octopodiforms, except Bathypolypus ergasticus, which appears to lack ND5, two tRNA genes that flank ND5 and two other tRNA genes. Argonautoidea was revealed as sister to Octopodidae by the mitochondrial protein-coding gene dataset, however, it was recovered as sister to all other incirrate octopods with strong support in an analysis using nuclear rRNA genes. Within Cirrata, our study supports two existing classifications suggesting neither is likely in conflict with the true evolutionary history of the suborder. Genome skimming is useful in the analysis of phylogenetic relationships within Octopoda; inclu-sion of both mitochondrial and nuclear data may be key.","[Taite, M.; Fernandez-Alvarez, F.

Pan-bacterial 16S rRNA gene polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and amplicon sequencing of affected tissue indicated the presence of a Neorickettsia. Neorickettsia is a genus of obligate intracellular Alphaproteobacteria that are transmitted by digenean trematodes. For further characterization, primers were designed to amplify and sequence the groEL gene. Phylogenetic analysis found that the organism was distinct from other known species to a degree consistent with a novel species. Immunohistochemistry using an antibody directed against a Neorickettsia surface protein showed bacterial clusters within the renal granulomas. A species-specific quantitative PCR was designed and detected the organism within the liver and colon of the index case. A quantitative PCR survey of grossly normal kidneys opportunistically collected from additional stranded sea turtle kidneys detected this organism in five of 15 Kemp's ridley turtles, two of nine green turtles, and neither of two loggerhead turtles. Recognition of this novel organism in an endangered species is concerning; additional work is underway to further characterize the potential of this organism as a pathogen of sea turtles.","[Liguori, Brittany L.; Archer, Linda L.; Childress, April L.; Kariyawasam, Subhashinie; Wellehan, James F.

Here, we used population genomics to infer the number, distribution and other characteristics of subspecies and populations. We used the largest DNA dataset in blue whales, both in terms of genomic markers (16,661 SNPs and mtDNA) and geographic coverage (n = 276 for SNPs; n = 531 for mtDNA). We found greatest divergence among the eastern Pacific, Indo-western Pacific and Antarctic blue whales. There were indications that natural selection in different environments promoted divergence among these groupings. Within these regions, there was divergence between the eastern North and eastern South Pacific, and among the eastern Indian Ocean, the western South Pacific and the northern Indian Ocean. There was no divergence within the Antarctic. These findings are consistent with the current classification of Antarctic and Indo-western Pacific blue whales in the Southern Hemisphere as different subspecies but call into question the subspecies taxonomy of eastern Pacific blue whales. The study shows that opposite breeding seasons on either side of the equator do not necessarily inhibit connectivity across the equator, and reinforces that population structure needs to be well understood to conserve the diversity within species. Blue whales are the largest living animal and became endangered due to whaling. We found three major groupings of blue whales using high-resolution population genomics: the eastern Pacific, Indo-western Pacific, and Antarctic blue whales.

However, the biogeochemical functioning of cyanobacterial mats under persistent low-O-2 conditions, which dominated their evolutionary history, is not well understood. To investigate how different metabolic and biogeochemical functions are partitioned among community members, we conducted metagenomics and metatranscriptomics on cyanobacterial mats in the low-O-2, sulfidic Middle Island sinkhole (MIS) in Lake Huron. Metagenomic assembly and binning yielded 144 draft metagenome assembled genomes, including 61 of medium quality or better, and the dominant cyanobacteria and numerous Proteobacteria involved in sulfur cycling. Strains of a Phormidium autumnale-like cyanobacterium dominated the metagenome and metatranscriptome. Transcripts for the photosynthetic reaction core genes psaA and psbA were abundant in both day and night. Multiple types of psbA genes were expressed from each cyanobacterium, and the dominant psbA transcripts were from an atypical microaerobic type of D1 protein from Phormidium. Further, cyanobacterial transcripts for photosystem I genes were more abundant than those for photo system II, and two types of Phormidium sulfide quinone reductase were recovered, consistent with anoxygenic photosynthesis via photosystem I in the presence of sulfide. Transcripts indicate active sulfur oxidation and reduction within the cyanobacterial mat, predominately by Gammaproteobacteria and Deltaproteobacteria, respectively. Overall, these genomic and transcriptomic results link specific microbial groups to metabolic processes that underpin primary production and biogeochemical cycling in a low-O-2 cyanobacterial mat and suggest mechanisms for tightly coupled cycling of oxygen and sulfur compounds in the mat ecosystem. IMPORTANCE Cyanobacterial mats are dense communities of microorganisms that contain photosynthetic cyanobacteria along with a host of other bacterial species that play important yet still poorly understood roles in this ecosystem. Although such cyanobacterial mats were critical agents of Earth's biological and chemical evolution through geological time, little is known about how they function under the low-oxygen conditions that characterized most of their natural history. Here, we performed sequencing of the DNA and RNA of modern cyanobacterial mat communities under low-oxygen and sulfur-rich conditions from the Middle Island sinkhole in Lake Huron. The results reveal the organisms and metabolic pathways that are responsible for both oxygen-producing and non-oxygen-producing photosynthesis as well as interconversions of sulfur that likely shape how much O-2 is produced in such ecosystems. These findings indicate tight metabolic reactions between community members that help to explain the limited the amount of O-2 produced in cyanobacterial mat ecosystems.","[Grim, Sharon L.; Voorhies, Alexander A.; Jain, Sunit; Dick, Gregory J.] Univ Michigan, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Biddanda, Bopaiah A.] Grand Valley State Univ, Annis Water Resources Inst, Muskegon, MI USA; [Nold, Stephen C.] Univ Wisconsin Stout, Biol Dept, Menomonie, WI USA; [Green, Russ] NOAA, Thunder Bay Natl Marine Sanctuary, Alpena, MI USA; [Dick, Gregory J.] Univ Michigan, Cooperat Inst Great Lakes Res, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Grim, Sharon L.] NASA, Ames Res Ctr, Moffett Field, CA USA; [Green, Russ] NOAA, Off Natl Marine Sanctuaries, Sheboygan, WI USA","University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; Grand Valley State University; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Stout; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Ames Research Center; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA","Dick, GJ (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.;Dick, GJ (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Cooperat Inst Great Lakes Res, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.","gdick@umich.edu","Dick, Gregory/D-8901-2012","","NSF [EAR1035957, EAR1035955, EAR 1637066]; University of Michigan CCMB Pilot Grant; Scott Turner Award","NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); University of Michigan CCMB Pilot Grant; Scott Turner Award","This work was supported by NSF grants EAR1035955 and EAR 1637066 to G.J.D., NSF grant EAR1035957 to B.A.B., the University of Michigan CCMB Pilot Grant to G.J.D., and the Scott Turner Award to A.A.V.",NA,113,8,8,2,15,"AMER SOC MICROBIOLOGY","WASHINGTON","1752 N ST NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036-2904 USA","2379-5077","","","MSYSTEMS","mSystems","NOV-DEC",2021,6,"6",NA,"","","",NA,NA,"e01042-21","10.1128/mSystems.01042-21","http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/mSystems.01042-21",NA,"",16,"Microbiology","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Microbiology","XV0CG",34874776,"Green Published","","","2024-10-25","WOS:000734620700001","View Full Record in Web of Science",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

While the toxic potential of planktonic cyanobacterial blooms is well documented, the ecosystem level effects of toxigenic benthic and epiphytic cyanobacteria are an understudied threat. The freshwater epiphytic cyanobacterium Aetokthonos hydrillicola has recently been shown to produce the eagle killer neurotoxin aetokthonotoxin (AETX) causing the fatal neurological disease vacuolar myelinopathy. The disease affects a wide array of wildlife in the southeastern United States, most notably waterfowl and birds of prey, including the bald eagle. In an assay for cytotoxicity, we found the crude extract of the cyanobacterium to be much more potent than pure AETX, prompting further investigation. Here, we describe the isolation and structure elucidation of the aetokthonostatins (AESTs), linear peptides belonging to the dolastatin compound family, featuring a unique modification of the C-terminal phenylalanine-derived moiety. Using immunofluorescence microscopy and molecular modeling, we confirmed that AEST potently impacts microtubule dynamics and can bind to tubulin in a similar matter as dolastatin 10. We also show that AEST inhibits reproduction of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Bioinformatic analysis revealed the AEST biosynthetic gene cluster encoding a non-ribosomal peptide synthetase/polyketide synthase accompanied by a unique tailoring machinery. The biosynthetic activity of a specific N-terminal methyltransferase was confirmed by in vitro biochemical studies, establishing a mechanistic link between the gene cluster and its product.","[Schwark, Markus; Roehrborn, Kristin; Niedermeyer, Timo H.

We examined whether juvenile growth and condition differed with respect to sex and a migration-associated genomic region (Omy05) in a coastal California population of steelhead and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). Sex and Omy05 genotype had additive effects on annual growth from age 0+ to age 1+ (similar to 6-18 months old), with higher growth in males and individuals with copies of the rearranged-resident haplotype. Condition at age 1+ increased with the number of copies of the rearranged-resident haplotype, with similar support for additive or interactive effects with sex; additive effects suggested that genotype differences occurred in both sexes and also that condition was slightly higher in males, while interactive effects suggested that the genotype differences occurred only in males. Our results indicate that phenotypic differences related to sex and Omy05 genotype occur well in advance of anadromous migration or freshwater maturation in this southern O. mykiss population.","[Rundio, David E.; Garza, John Carlos; Lindley, Steven T.; Williams, Thomas H.; Pearse, Devon E.] NOAA, Fisheries Ecol Div, Southwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, 110 McAllister Way, Santa Cruz, CA 95060 USA","National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA","Rundio, DE (corresponding author), NOAA, Fisheries Ecol Div, Southwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, 110 McAllister Way, Santa Cruz, CA 95060 USA.","dave.rundio@noaa.gov","Lindley, Steven T./G-3997-2014","Lindley, Steven T./0000-0001-9556-0411; Rundio, David/0000-0002-9881-2626","","","",NA,68,6,8,0,5,"CANADIAN SCIENCE PUBLISHING","OTTAWA","123 Slater Street, Suite 610, OTTAWA, ON K1P 5H2, CANADA","0706-652X","1205-7533","","CAN J FISH AQUAT SCI","Can.

Analyses of these genome-wide datasets have documented many examples of novel structural variants (SVs) such as chromosomal inversions, copy number variants, and chromosomal translocations, many of which have been linked to adaptation. The salmonids are a taxonomic group with abundant genome-wide datasets due to their importance in aquaculture and fisheries. However, the number of documented SVs in salmonids is surprisingly low and is most likely due to removing loci in high linkage disequilibrium when analyzing structure and gene flow. Here we re-analyze RAD-seq data from several populations of Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus) and document a novel similar to 1.2 MB SV at the distal end of LG12. This variant contains 15 protein-coding genes connected to a wide-range of functions including cell adhesion and signal transduction. Interestingly, we studied the frequency of this polymorphism in four disjointed populations of charr-one each from Nunavut, Newfoundland, Eastern Russia, and Scotland-and found evidence of the variant only in Nunavut, Canada, suggesting the polymorphism is novel and recently evolved.","[Hale, Matthew C.] Texas Christian Univ, Dept Biol, Ft Worth, TX 76129 USA; [Campbell, Matthew A.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Anim Sci, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Campbell, Matthew A.] Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Univ Alaska Museum, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA; [McKinney, Garrett J.] NOAA, Natl Res Council Res Associateship Program, Northwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Seattle, WA 98112 USA; [McKinney, Garrett J.] Washington Dept Fish & Wildlife, Mol Genet Lab, Olympia, WA 98501 USA","Texas Christian University; University of California System; University of California Davis; University of Alaska System; University of Alaska Fairbanks; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Washington Department of Fish & Wildlife (WDFW)","Hale, MC (corresponding author), Texas Christian Univ, Dept Biol, Ft Worth, TX 76129 USA.","m.c.hale@tcu.edu","","Hale, Matthew/0000-0002-7391-2727; Campbell, Matthew/0000-0002-5826-0329","","","",NA,44,6,6,0,0,"OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC","CARY","JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA","2160-1836","","","G3-GENES GENOM GENET","G3-Genes Genomes Genet.","OCT",2021,11,"10",NA,"","","",NA,NA,"jkab267","10.1093/g3journal/jkab267","http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/g3journal/jkab267",NA,"JUL 2021",7,"Genetics & Heredity","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Genetics & Heredity","XW0VN",34568922,"Green Published","","","2024-10-25","WOS:000735347900025","View Full Record in Web of Science",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We capitalized on this unusual distribution to study the evolutionary history of the girellids, and determine the relationship between G. stuebeli and the remaining nibbler taxa. Based on thousands of genomic markers (RAD sequences), we identified the closest relatives of G. stuebeli as being a clade of three species endemic to the northwestern Pacific, restricted to the Sea of Japan and vicinity. This clade diverged from G. stuebeli approximately 2.2 Mya. Two alternative potential routes of migration may explain this affinity: a western route, from the Tropical Eastern Pacific and the Tropical Western Atlantic, and an eastern route via the Indian Ocean and Southern Africa. The geological history and oceanography of the regions combined with molecular data presented here, suggest that the eastern route of invasion (via the Indian Ocean and Southern Africa) is a more likely scenario.","[Beldade, Ricardo; Perez-Matus, Alejandro] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Ciencias Biol, Dept Ecol, Estn Costera Invest Marinas, Santiago, Chile; [Longo, Gary C.] NOAA, NRC Res Associateship Program, Northwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, 2725 Montlake Blvd E, Seattle, WA 98112 USA; [Clements, Kendall D.] Univ Auckland, Sch Biol Sci, Private Bag 92019, Auckland, New Zealand; [Robertson, D.

One of the most studied shallow hydrothermal vent fields lies at Paleochori Bay off the coast of Milos in the Aegean Sea (Greece). It has been studied through extensive mapping and its physical and chemical processes have been characterized over the past decades. However, a thorough description of the microbial communities inhabiting the bay is still missing. MethodsWe present the first in-depth characterization of the prokaryotic communities of Paleochori Bay by sampling eight different seafloor types that are distributed along the entire gradient of hydrothermal influence. We used deep sequencing of the 16S rRNA marker gene and complemented the analysis with qPCR quantification of the 16S rRNA gene and several functional genes to gain insights into the metabolic potential of the communities. ResultsWe found that the microbiome of the bay is strongly influenced by the hydrothermal venting, with a succession of various groups dominating the sediments from the coldest to the warmest zones. Prokaryotic diversity and abundance decrease with increasing temperature, and thermophilic archaea overtake the community. DiscussionRelevant geochemical cycles of the Bay are discussed. This study expands our limited understanding of subsurface microbial communities in acidic shallow-sea hydrothermal systems and the contribution of their microbial activity to biogeochemical cycling.","[Bauer, Sven Le Moine; Goulaouic, Steven; Barreyre, Thibaut; Jorgensen, Steffen Leth] Univ Bergen, Ctr Deep Sea Res, Dept Earth Sci, Bergen, Norway; [Lu, Guang-Sin] Univ Washington, Cooperat Inst Climate Ocean & Ecosyst Studies, Seattle, WA USA; [Lu, Guang-Sin] NOAA Pacific Marine Environm Lab, Seattle, WA USA; [Puzenat, Valentine] Univ Paris Cite, Inst Phys Globe Paris, CNRS, Paris, France; [Schouw, Anders] Univ Bergen, Ctr Deep Sea Res, Dept Biol, Bergen, Norway; [Pawlowsky-Glahn, Vera] Univ Girona, Dept Comp Sci Appl Math & Stat, Girona, Spain; [Egozcue, Juan Jose] Univ Politecn Cataluna, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Barcelona, Spain; [Martelat, Jean-Emmanuel] Univ Lyon, UCBL, ENSL, CNRS,Lab Geol LGL TPE, Villeurbanne, France; [Escartin, Javier] PSL Univ, Ecole Normale Super Paris, Lab Geol, CNRS UMR8538, Paris, France; [Amend, Jan P.] Univ Southern Calif, Dept Earth Sci & Biol Sci, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Nomikou, Paraskevi; Vlasopoulos, Othonas] Natl & Kapodistrian Univ Athens, Fac Geol & Geoenvironm, Athens, Greece; [Polymenakou, Paraskevi] Hellen Ctr Marine Res, Inst Marine Biol Biotechnol & Aquaculture, Iraklion, Greece","University of Bergen; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite Paris Cite; University of Bergen; Universitat de Girona; Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya; Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1; Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon (ENS de LYON); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite PSL; Ecole Normale Superieure (ENS); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - National Institute for Earth Sciences & Astronomy (INSU); University of Southern California; National & Kapodistrian University of Athens; Hellenic Centre for Marine Research","Bauer, SL (corresponding author), Univ Bergen, Ctr Deep Sea Res, Dept Earth Sci, Bergen, Norway.","sven.bauer@uib.no","Barreyre, Thibaut/AAF-8195-2021; Egozcue, Juan/B-6499-2009; Martelat, Jean-Emmanuel/E-3135-2010; Polymenakou, Paraskevi/AAW-5313-2020; ESCARTIN, Javier/A-1043-2010","Barreyre, Thibaut/0000-0002-5109-2633; ESCARTIN, Javier/0000-0002-3416-6856; Le Moine Bauer, Sven/0000-0003-0694-6190","NSF [OIA-0939564]; Center for Dark Energy Biosphere Investigations (C-DEBI) - INSU-CNRS Tellus and Syster Projects; INSU-CNRS Tellus and Syster Projects; RAMONES - European Union [101017808]; Trond Mohn Foundation; University of Bergen [TMS2020TMT13]; Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation; European Regional Development Fund (MCIN/AEI/FEDER) [PID2021-125380OB-I00, PID2021-123833OB-I00]","NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Center for Dark Energy Biosphere Investigations (C-DEBI) - INSU-CNRS Tellus and Syster Projects; INSU-CNRS Tellus and Syster Projects; RAMONES - European Union; Trond Mohn Foundation; University of Bergen; Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation(Ministry of Science and Innovation, Spain (MICINN)Spanish Government); European Regional Development Fund (MCIN/AEI/FEDER)(European Union (EU)Marie Curie Actions)","Funding for the Saganaki dataset and JPA and G-SL was provided by NSF grants OIA-0939564 to the Center for Dark Energy Biosphere Investigations (C-DEBI).

Histopathological findings included intranuclear inclusions in bile duct epithelium, lymphoid depletion, rare syncytial cells and non-suppurative meningitis. Cerebellum and lung tissue homogenates were inoculated onto Vero.DogSLAMtag cells for virus isolation and cytopathic effects were observed, resulting in the formation of multinucleated giant cells (i.e., syncytia). Transmission electron microscopy of infected cell cultures also revealed syncytial cells with intracytoplasmic and intranuclear inclusions of viral nucleocapsids, consistent with the ultrastructure of a morbillivirus. Samples of the cerebellum, lung, liver, spleen and lymph nodes were positive for morbillivirus using a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The resulting 559 bp L gene sequence had the highest nucleotide identity (77.3%) to porpoise morbillivirus from Northern Ireland and the Netherlands. The resulting 248 bp P gene had the highest nucleotide identity to porpoise morbillivirus in Northern Ireland and the Netherlands and to a stranded Guiana dolphin (Sotalia guianensis) in Brazil (66.9%).

Despite their considerable spatial scale and impact on biogeochemical cycles, niche differentiation of abundant microbial clades is poorly understood. Here, we analyzed the microbial ecology of two bathy- (Brothers volcano; BrV-cone and northwest caldera; NWC) and a mesopelagic (Macauley volcano; McV) plumes on the Kermadec intra-oceanic arc in the South Pacific Ocean. The microbial community structure, determined by a combination of 16S rRNA gene, fluorescence in situ hybridization and metagenome analysis, was similar to the communities observed in other sulfur-rich plumes. This includes a dominance of the vent characteristic SUP05 clade (up to 22% in McV and 51% in BrV). In each of the three plumes analyzed, the community was dominated by a different yet uncultivated chemoautotrophic SUP05 species, here, provisionally named, Candidatus Thioglobus vadi (McV), Candidatus Thioglobus vulcanius (BrV-cone) and Candidatus Thioglobus plumae (BrV-NWC). Statistical analyses, genomic potential and mRNA expression profiles suggested a SUP05 niche partitioning based on sulfide and iron concentration as well as water depth. A fourth SUP05 species was present at low frequency throughout investigated plume samples and may be capable of heterotrophic or mixotrophic growth.

The prevalence of FP is highest in green sea turtle (Chelonia mydas) populations, and historically has shown considerable temporal growth. FP tumors can significantly affect the ability of turtles to forage for food and avoid predation and can grow to debilitating sizes. In the current study, based in South Texas, we have applied transcriptome sequencing to FP tumors and healthy control tissue to study the gene expression profiles of FP. By identifying differentially expressed turtle genes in FP, and matching these genes to their closest human ortholog we draw on the wealth of human based knowledge, specifically human cancer, to identify new insights into the biology of sea turtle FP. We show that several genes aberrantly expressed in FP tumors have known tumor promoting biology in humans, including CTHRC1 and NLRC5, and provide support that disruption of the Wnt signaling pathway is a feature of FP. Further, we profiled the expression of current targets of immune checkpoint inhibitors from human oncology in FP tumors and identified potential candidates for future studies.","[Blackburn, Nicholas B.; Leandro, Ana Cristina; Leandro, Marcelo; Peralta, Juan M.; Blangero, John; Curran, Joanne E.] Univ Texas Rio Grande Valley, Dept Human Genet, Sch Med, Brownsville, TX 78520 USA; [Blackburn, Nicholas B.; Leandro, Ana Cristina; Leandro, Marcelo; Peralta, Juan M.; Blangero, John; Curran, Joanne E.] Univ Texas Rio Grande Valley, South Texas Diabet & Obes Inst, Sch Med, Brownsville, TX 78520 USA; [Blackburn, Nicholas B.; Peralta, Juan M.] Univ Tasmania, Menzies Inst Med Res, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [Nahvi, Nina; Devlin, Mariana A.; George, Jeff] Sea Turtle Inc, South Padre Isl, TX USA; [Escobedo, Ignacio Martinez] Univ Texas Rio Grande Valley, Sch Med, Edinburg, TX USA; [Stacy, Brian A.] Univ Florida, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Off Protected Resources, Gainesville, FL USA; [deMaar, Thomas W.] Gladys Porter Zoo, Brownsville, TX USA; [Keniry, Megan] Univ Texas Rio Grande Valley, Dept Biol, Coll Sci, Edinburg, TX USA","University of Texas System; University of Texas Rio Grande Valley; University of Texas System; University of Texas Rio Grande Valley; University of Tasmania; Menzies Institute for Medical Research; University of Texas System; University of Texas Rio Grande Valley; State University System of Florida; University of Florida; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of Texas System; University of Texas Rio Grande Valley","Blackburn, NB (corresponding author), Univ Texas Rio Grande Valley, Dept Human Genet, Sch Med, Brownsville, TX 78520 USA.;Blackburn, NB (corresponding author), Univ Texas Rio Grande Valley, South Texas Diabet & Obes Inst, Sch Med, Brownsville, TX 78520 USA.;Blackburn, NB (corresponding author), Univ Tasmania, Menzies Inst Med Res, Hobart, Tas, Australia.","nicholas.blackburn@urtas.edu.au","Blangero, John/ABA-7175-2021; Blackburn, Nicholas/G-5114-2014; Leandro, Ana/C-8412-2012","Martinez Escobedo, Ignacio/0000-0002-6562-8697; Curran, Joanne/0000-0002-6898-155X","University of Texas Rio Grande Valley Transforming OurWorld Strategic Plan","University of Texas Rio Grande Valley Transforming OurWorld Strategic Plan","This work was funded by the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley Transforming OurWorld Strategic Plan.",NA,90,14,15,1,21,"FRONTIERS MEDIA SA","LAUSANNE","AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND","1664-3224","","","FRONT IMMUNOL","Front.

Patterns of marine dispersal remain poorly understood, partly because dispersal may vary through time and often homogenizes allele frequencies. However, combining multiple types of natural tags can provide more precise dispersal estimates, and biological collections can help to reconstruct dispersal patterns through time. We used single nucleotide polymorphism genotypes and otolith core microchemistry from archived collections of larval summer flounder (Paralichthys dentatus, n = 411) captured between 1989 and 2012 at five locations along the US East coast to reconstruct dispersal patterns through time. Neither genotypes nor otolith microchemistry alone were sufficient to identify the source of larval fish. However, microchemistry identified clusters of larvae (n = 3-33 larvae per cluster) that originated in the same location, and genetic assignment of clusters could be made with substantially more confidence. We found that most larvae probably originated near a biogeographical break (Cape Hatteras) and that larvae were transported in both directions across this break. Larval sources did not shift north through time, despite the northward shift of adult populations in recent decades. Our novel approach demonstrates that summer flounder dispersal is widespread throughout their range, on both intra- and intergenerational timescales, and may be a particularly important process for synchronizing population dynamics and maintaining genetic diversity during an era of rapid environmental change. Broadly, our results reveal the value of archived collections and of combining multiple natural tags to understand the magnitude and directionality of dispersal in species with extensive gene flow.","[Hoey, Jennifer A.; Pinsky, Malin L.] Rutgers State Univ, Ecol Evolut & Nat Resources, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA; [Fodrie, F.

However, not all individuals return to their natal breeding grounds-a behavioural trait known as straying. The prevalence of straying is difficult to explore and therefore quantitative estimates for straying are seldom reported. In this study, otolith microchemistry and genetics were combined to investigate patterns of straying over ecological and evolutionary time, respectively, between neighbouring rivers flowing into Mariager fjord, Denmark. Otolith microchemistry was used to determine the river of origin for sea trout (Salmo trutta) upon their return to freshwater and 288 SNP markers were used to determine genetic structure among the rivers in the fjord. In this system, where the distance between rivers is short, otolith microchemistry achieved 80% accuracy in assigning juvenile brown trout to their natal river, thus allowing us to determine that approximately 43% of the adult sea trout had returned to non-natal rivers to spawn, with a similar proportion of strayers and natal homers in all of the rivers. Genetic analysis further supported that there was substantial gene flow among individuals originating from different rivers, indicating that sea trout in Mariager fjord make up one population. The findings obtained from otolith microchemistry and genetics complement each other and provide further evidence that sea trout in this system migrate to non-natal rivers and spawn there, which consequently affects the genetic structure of the population.","[Kallo, Kristi; Birnie-Gauvin, Kim; Baktoft, Henrik; Bekkevold, Dorte; Aarestrup, Kim] Tech Univ Denmark, Natl Inst Aquat Sci, Silkeborg, Denmark; [Lesher, Charles; Barfod, Gry H.] Aarhus Univ, Inst Geosci, Aarhus, Denmark; [Lesher, Charles] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Davis, CA USA; [Gronkjaer, Peter] Aarhus Univ, Dept Biol, Aarhus, Denmark; [Johnson, Rachel] NOAA Fisheries, Southwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Fisheries Ecol Div, Santa Cruz, CA USA; [Johnson, Rachel; Whitman, George] Univ Calif Davis, Ctr Watershed Sci, Davis, CA USA; [Willmes, Malte] Norwegian Inst Nat Res, Trondheim, Norway; [Glessner, Justin] Univ Calif Davis, Interdisciplinary Ctr Plasma Mass Spectrometry, Davis, CA USA; [Aarestrup, Kim] Tech Univ Denmark, Natl Inst Aquat Sci, Vejlsovej 39, DK-8600 Silkeborg, Denmark","Technical University of Denmark; Aarhus University; University of California System; University of California Davis; Aarhus University; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of California System; University of California Davis; Norwegian Institute Nature Research; University of California System; University of California Davis; Technical University of Denmark","Aarestrup, K (corresponding author), Tech Univ Denmark, Natl Inst Aquat Sci, Vejlsovej 39, DK-8600 Silkeborg, Denmark.","kaa@aqua.dtu.dk","Birnie-Gauvin, Kim/G-5306-2018; Barfod, Gry/A-2466-2015; Willmes, Malte/J-3710-2015; Bekkevold, Dorte/AAT-1098-2021; Aarestrup, Kim/AAK-9155-2021; Baktoft, Henrik/E-6581-2011; Gronkjaer, Peter/A-3697-2008","Aarestrup, Kim/0000-0001-8521-6270; Baktoft, Henrik/0000-0002-3644-4960; Bekkevold, Dorte/0000-0002-5297-032X; Gronkjaer, Peter/0000-0003-1337-4661; Barfod, Gry Hoffmann/0000-0002-7000-0757","The authors thank Andreas Svarer for his help on the field and Dorte Meldrup and Kimberly Evans for their help with the genetics and strontium isotope analyses, respectively.

The significant morphological differentiation observed between these ecotypes suggests they represent two different subspecies. However, there is still a need to investigate whether there is congruence between morphological and genetic data to rule out the possibility of ecophenotypic variation accompanied by gene flow. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region sequence data and 10 microsatellite loci collected from stranded and biopsied dolphins sampled in coastal and offshore waters of Brazil as well as 106 skulls for morphological analyses were used to determine whether the morphological differentiation was supported by genetic differentiation. There was congruence among the data sets, reinforcing the presence of two distinct ecotypes. The divergence may be relatively recent, however, given the moderate values of mtDNA nucleotide divergence (dA = 0.008), presence of one shared mtDNA haplotype and possibly low levels of gene flow (around 1% of migrants per generation). Results suggest the ecotypes may be in the process of speciation and reinforce they are best described as two different subspecies until the degree of nuclear genetic divergence is thoroughly evaluated: Tursiops truncatus gephyreus (coastal ecotype) and T. t. truncatus (offshore ecotype). The endemic distribution of T. t. gephyreus in the western South Atlantic and number of anthropogenic threats in the area reinforces the importance of protecting this ecotype and its habitat.AUTHOR: Graphical abstract caption extracted from reliable source (metadata xml) file.

Many generations later, only the freshwater resident life history is expressed in the Chubut and Negro rivers of northern Argentinian Patagonia, whereas both the resident and anadromous life histories are found in the Santa Cruz River of southern Argentina. Despite previous studies that have tried to identify the sources of these introduced populations, uncertainty still exists. Here we combined data from many single-nucleotide polymorphisms and microsatellite loci in O. mykiss populations from Argentina and North America to evaluate putative source populations, gene flow between Argentinian river basins, and genetic diversity differences between Argentinian and North American populations. We found that populations from northern and southern Patagonia are highly differentiated and have limited gene flow between them. Phylogeographic analysis also confirmed that they have separate origins, with the northern populations most closely related to the domesticated rainbow trout strains that are raised worldwide and the Santa Cruz River populations most closely related to North American populations from California and Oregon that have an anadromous component. In addition, fish with different life histories in the Santa Cruz River were found to constitute a single interbreeding population. No evidence was found of reduced genetic variation in introduced rainbow trout, suggesting multiple contributing sources. In spite of these advances in understanding, significant questions remain regarding the origins and evolution of the introduced O. mykiss in Patagonia.","[Lazari, Carolina; Clemento, Anthony J.; Pearse, Devon E.; Garza, John Carlos] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Ocean Sci Dept, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Riva-Rossi, Carla] Inst Divers & Evoluc Austral IDEAus CONICET, Puerto Madryn, Argentina; [Ciancio, Javier] Ctr Para Estudio Sistemas Marinos CESIMAR CONICET, Puerto Madryn, Argentina; [Pascual, Miguel] Inst Patagon Estudio Ecosistemas Continentales IPE, Puerto Madryn, Argentina; [Clemento, Anthony J.; Pearse, Devon E.; Garza, John Carlos] NOAA, Southwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, 110 MacAllister Way, Santa Cruz, CA 95060 USA","University of California System; University of California Santa Cruz; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA","Garza, JC (corresponding author), NOAA, Southwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, 110 MacAllister Way, Santa Cruz, CA 95060 USA.","carlos.garza@noaa.gov","","","US/Argentina Fulbright Commission; Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET) of Argentina; Agencia Nacional de Promocion Cientifica y Tecnologica of Argentina; Subsecretaria de Pescay Asuntos Portuarios de la Provincia de Santa Cruz, Argentina","US/Argentina Fulbright Commission; Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET) of Argentina(Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET)); Agencia Nacional de Promocion Cientifica y Tecnologica of Argentina(ANPCyT); Subsecretaria de Pescay Asuntos Portuarios de la Provincia de Santa Cruz, Argentina","Funding for this research was provided by the US/Argentina Fulbright Commission to Carolina Lazari, the Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET) of Argentina to Carla Riva-Rossi and Miguel Pascual, and the Agencia Nacional de Promocion Cientifica y Tecnologica of Argentina and the Subsecretaria de Pescay Asuntos Portuarios de la Provincia de Santa Cruz, Argentina, to Miguel Pascual.",NA,94,0,0,2,3,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","0022-1112","1095-8649","","J FISH BIOL","J.

The spectrum of relationships between plastics and bacteria, however, is little understood. The first objective of this study was to examine plastics as substrates for communities of Bacteria in estuarine surface waters. We used next-generation sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene to characterize communities from plastics collected in the field, and over the course of two colonization experiments, from biofilms that developed on plastic (low-density polyethylene, high-density polyethylene, polypropylene, polycarbonate, polystyrene) and glass substrates placed in the environment. Both field sampling and colonization experiments were conducted in estuarine tributaries of the lower Chesapeake Bay. As a second objective, we concomitantly analyzed biofilms on plastic substrates to ascertain the presence and abundance ofVibriospp. bacteria, then isolated three human pathogens,V.cholerae,V.parahaemolyticus, andV.vulnificus, and determined their antibiotic-resistant profiles. In both components of this study, we compared our results with analyses conducted on paired samples of estuarine water. This research adds to a nascent literature that suggests environmental factors govern the development of bacterial communities on plastics, more so than the characteristics of the plastic substrates themselves. In addition, this study is the first to culture three pathogenic vibrios from plastics in estuaries, reinforcing and expanding upon earlier reports of plastic pollution as a habitat forVibriospecies. The antibiotic resistance detected among the isolates, coupled with the longevity of plastics in the aqueous environment, suggests biofilms on plastics have potential to persist and serve as focal points of potential pathogens and horizontal gene transfer.","[Laverty, Amanda L.; Dobbs, Fred C.] Old Dominion Univ, Dept Ocean Earth & Atmospher Sci, Norfolk, VA 23529 USA; [Primpke, Sebastian; Lorenz, Claudia; Gerdts, Gunnar] Biol Anstalt Helgoland, Alfred Wegener Inst, Helmholtz Ctr Polar & Marine Res, Helgoland, Germany; [Laverty, Amanda L.] NOAA, Dept Commerce, Natl Environm Satellite Data & Informat Serv, Program Anal Branch, Silver Spring, MD USA; [Lorenz, Claudia] Aalborg Univ, Dept Built Environm, Aalborg, Denmark","Old Dominion University; Helmholtz Association; Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar & Marine Research; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Aalborg University","Laverty, AL (corresponding author), Old Dominion Univ, Dept Ocean Earth & Atmospher Sci, Norfolk, VA 23529 USA.","amandaleelaverty@gmail.com","Lorenz, Claudia/AAL-7956-2021; Primpke, Sebastian/Q-5606-2016; Gerdts, Gunnar/R-7000-2016","Lorenz, Claudia/0000-0002-7898-7728; Laverty, Amanda/0000-0002-4146-398X","Hampton Roads Environmental Scholarship; Susan Kelley Endowed Scholarship; VWRRC's Student Competitive Grants Program; NSF [DMS-1412826]; Neil and Susan Kelley Endowed Scholarship","Hampton Roads Environmental Scholarship; Susan Kelley Endowed Scholarship; VWRRC's Student Competitive Grants Program; NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Neil and Susan Kelley Endowed Scholarship","Funding was provided by Hampton Roads Environmental Scholarship (ALL); Dorothy Brown Smith Scholarship (ALL); Neil and Susan Kelley Endowed Scholarship (ALL); VWRRC's Student Competitive Grants Program (ALL); and NSF Grant #DMS-1412826 (FCD).

Beaked whales (ziphiids) are among the most visible inhabitants of the deep sea, due to their large size and worldwide distribution, and their taxonomic diversity and much about their natural history remain poorly understood. We combine genomic and morphometric analyses to reveal a new Southern Hemisphere ziphiid species, Ramari's beaked whale, Mesoplodon eueu, whose name is linked to the Indigenous peoples of the lands from which the species holotype and paratypes were recovered. Mitogenome and ddRAD-derived phylogenies demonstrate reciprocally monophyletic divergence between M. eueu and True's beaked whale (M. mirus) from the North Atlantic, with which it was previously subsumed. Morphometric analyses of skulls also distinguish the two species. A time-calibrated mitogenome phylogeny and analysis of two nuclear genomes indicate divergence began circa 2 million years ago (Ma), with geneflow ceasing 0.35-0.55 Ma. This is an example of how deep sea biodiversity can be unravelled through increasing international collaboration and genome sequencing of archival specimens. Our consultation and involvement with Indigenous peoples offers a model for broadening the cultural scope of the scientific naming process.","[Carroll, Emma L.; Constantine, Rochelle] Univ Auckland Waipapa Taumata Rau, Sch Biol Sci Te Kura Matauranga Koiora, Auckland 1010, New Zealand; [McGowen, Michael R.; Mead, James G.] Smithsonian Natl Museum Nat Hist, Dept Vertebrate Zool, Washington, DC 20560 USA; [McCarthy, Morgan L.; Dreyer, Sascha; Hansen, Sabine S.; Olsen, Morten Tange] Univ Copenhagen, GLOBE Inst, Sect Evolutionary Genom, Oster Farimagsgade 5, DK-1353 Copenhagen K, Denmark; [Marx, Felix G.; Fordyce, R.

There have been several rangewide population genetic analyses of Pacific Hake Merluccius productus; however, a thorough focus on the heavily harvested coastal stock off the west coast of North America is missing. Recent observations of spatial-temporal variability in life history and migratory patterns of the coastal population have brought into question whether this variation may be related to genetic differentiation. Methods: Here, we used restriction site-associated DNA sequencing markers to thoroughly assess the potential for spatial-temporal genetic differentiation in the coastal stock of Pacific Hake. We sampled during different seasons from British Columbia down to the U.S.-Mexico border over multiple years on what traditionally have been thought to constitute spawning and feeding grounds, resulting in the most comprehensive assessment of coastal Pacific Hake population structure to date. Result: Generally, our results suggest very weak to no structure among coastal spatial-temporal sites and corroborate previous findings of strong differentiation between coastal and Salish Sea populations. The lack of structure among coastal sites is likely due to significant amounts of gene flow in this highly migratory population. Conclusion: These findings align with the ongoing management strategy for coastal Pacific Hake, which is based on an annual stock assessment that considers the coastal stock homogenous and distinct from the Salish Sea population. The understanding that management units indeed match genetic populations provides managers with additional confidence in existing management strategy.","[Longo, Gary C.] NOAA, Natl Res Council Res Associateship Program, Northwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Seattle, WA 98115 USA; [Head, Melissa A.; Taylor, Ian G.; Tuttle, Vanessa J.; Billings, Alicia A.] NOAA, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Northwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Fishery Resource Anal & Monitoring Div, Seattle, WA USA; [Parker-Stetter, Sandy L.] NOAA, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Alaska Fisheries Sci Ctr, Seattle, WA USA; [Gauthier, Stephane] Inst Ocean Sci, Fisheries & Oceans Canada, Sidney, BC, Canada; [McClure, Michelle M.] NOAA, Pacific Marine Environm Lab, Seattle, WA USA; [Nichols, Krista M.] NOAA, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Northwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Conservat Biol Div, Seattle, WA USA; [Longo, Gary C.] NOAA, Ocean Associates Inc, Southwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA","National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Fisheries & Oceans Canada; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA","Longo, GC (corresponding author), NOAA, Natl Res Council Res Associateship Program, Northwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Seattle, WA 98115 USA.;Longo, GC (corresponding author), NOAA, Ocean Associates Inc, Southwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.","garycharleslongo@gmail.com","McClure, Michelle/O-7853-2015","Longo, Gary/0000-0002-4282-9111","National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) Office of Science and Technology","National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) Office of Science and Technology","We thank Rebecca Thomas and Paul Chittaro for insightful discussions regarding Pacific Hake spawning, and we are grateful to Abigail Wells for assistance with DNA extractions.

Depth has recently been proposed as a potential driver of ecological divergence in fishes, and yet it is unclear how adaptation along these gradients' shapes genomic divergence. The genus Sebastes contains numerous species pairs that are depth-segregated and can provide a better understanding of the mode and tempo of genomic diversification. Here, we present exome data on two species pairs of rockfishes that are depth-segregated and have different degrees of divergence: S. chlorostictus-S. rosenblatti and S. crocotulus-S. miniatus. We were able to reliably identify islands of divergence in the species pair with more recent divergence (S. chlorostictus-S. rosenblatti) and discovered a number of genes associated with neurosensory function, suggesting a role for this pathway in the early speciation process. We also reconstructed demographic histories of divergence and found the best supported model was isolation followed by asymmetric secondary contact for both species pairs. These results suggest past ecological/geographic isolation followed by asymmetric secondary contact of deep to shallow species. Our results provide another example of using rockfish as a model for studying speciation and support the role of depth as an important mechanism for diversification in the marine environment.","[Olivares-Zambrano, Daniel; Aguilar, Andres] Calif State Univ Los Angeles, Dept Biol Sci, Los Angeles, CA 90032 USA; [Daane, Jacob] Univ Houston, Dept Biol & Biochem, Houston, TX USA; [Hyde, John] NOAA, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Southwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, La Jolla, CA USA; [Sandel, Michael W.] Univ West Alabama, Biol & Environm Sci, Livingston, AL USA; [Sandel, Michael W.] Mississippi State Univ, Dept Wildlife Fisheries & Aquaculture, Mississippi State, MS 39762 USA; [Olivares-Zambrano, Daniel] Univ Southern Calif, Dept Marine & Environm Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90007 USA","California State University System; California State University Los Angeles; University of Houston System; University of Houston; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of West Alabama; Mississippi State University; University of Southern California","Aguilar, A (corresponding author), Calif State Univ Los Angeles, Dept Biol Sci, Los Angeles, CA 90032 USA.","aaguil67@calstatela.edu","; Sandel, Michael/AAZ-2000-2020","Aguilar, Andres/0000-0002-4409-9597; Sandel, Michael/0000-0001-9083-9202","Council on Ocean Affairs Science and Technology, California State University [COAST--GDP-2019--001, CSUCOAST--OLIDAN-CSULA--AY1920]; National Institutes of Health [R25GM061331]; National Science Foundation [DEB-2121145]","Council on Ocean Affairs Science and Technology, California State University; National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF))","Council on Ocean Affairs Science and Technology, California State University, Grant/Award Number: COAST--GDP-2019--001 and CSUCOAST--OLIDAN-CSULA--AY1920; National Institutes of Health, Grant/Award Number: R25GM061331; National Science Foundation, Grant/Award Number: DEB-2121145",NA,69,3,4,0,8,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","2045-7758","","","ECOL EVOL","Ecol.

However, genome-wide DNA methylation studies in nonmodel organisms are currently hampered by a limited understanding of methodological biases. Here, we compare three methods for quantifying DNA methylation at single base-pair resolution-whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS), reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS), and methyl-CpG binding domain bisulfite sequencing (MBDBS)-using multiple individuals from two reef-building coral species with contrasting environmental sensitivity. All methods reveal substantially greater methylation in Montipora capitata (11.4%) than the more sensitive Pocillopora acuta (2.9%). The majority of CpG methylation in both species occurs in gene bodies and flanking regions. In both species, MBDBS has the greatest capacity for detecting CpGs in coding regions at our sequencing depth, but MBDBS may be influenced by intrasample methylation heterogeneity. RRBS yields robust information for specific loci albeit without enrichment of any particular genome feature and with significantly reduced genome coverage. Relative genome size strongly influences the number and location of CpGs detected by each method when sequencing depth is limited, illuminating nuances in cross-species comparisons. As genome-wide methylation differences, supported by data across bisulfite sequencing methods, may contribute to environmental sensitivity phenotypes in critical marine invertebrate taxa, these data provide a genomic resource for investigating the functional role of DNA methylation in environmental tolerance.","[Trigg, Shelly A.; Venkataraman, Yaamini R.; Roberts, Steven B.] Univ Washington, Sch Aquat & Fishery Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Venkataraman, Yaamini R.] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Biol Dept, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; [Gavery, Mackenzie R.] Natl Ocean & Atmospher Adm, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Northwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Environm & Fisheries Sci Div, Seattle, WA USA; [Bhattacharya, Debashish] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Biochem & Microbiol, New Brunswick, NJ USA; [Downey-Wall, Alan; Lotterhos, Katie E.] Northeastern Univ, Dept Marine & Environm Sci, Nahant, MA USA; [Eirin-Lopez, Jose M.] Florida Int Univ, Environm Epigenet Lab, Inst Environm, North Miami, FL USA; [Johnson, Kevin M.] Calif Polytech State Univ San Luis Obispo, Ctr Coastal Marine Sci, San Luis Obispo, CA 93407 USA; [Johnson, Kevin M.] Univ Calif San Diego, Calif Sea Grant, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Puritz, Jonathan B.; Putnam, Hollie M.] Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Biol Sci, Kingston, RI 02881 USA","University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Rutgers University System; Rutgers University New Brunswick; Northeastern University; State University System of Florida; Florida International University; California State University System; California Polytechnic State University San Luis Obispo; University of California System; University of California San Diego; University of Rhode Island","Putnam, HM (corresponding author), Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Biol Sci, Kingston, RI 02881 USA.","hputnam@uri.edu","Putnam, Hollie/AFJ-8174-2022; VENKATARAMAN, YAAMINI/HJB-3220-2022; Marquez Johnson, Kevin/Q-1310-2018; Puritz, Jonathan/C-9289-2011; Venkataraman, Yaamini/ABC-3045-2020","Roberts, Steven/0000-0001-8302-1138; Marquez Johnson, Kevin/0000-0003-3278-3508; Puritz, Jonathan/0000-0003-1404-4680; Lotterhos, Kathleen/0000-0001-7529-2771; Venkataraman, Yaamini/0000-0002-0364-1829; Bhattacharya, Debashish/0000-0003-0611-1273; Gavery, Mackenzie/0000-0001-5010-3399","USDA: National Institute of Food and Agriculture [1017848, NJ01180]; NRSP-8 National Animal Genome Research Program; National Science Foundation [1756623, 1921465, 1756616, 1921149, 1921402, 1635423]; Direct For Biological Sciences; Emerging Frontiers [1921402] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Direct For Biological Sciences; Emerging Frontiers [1921465, 1921149] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Directorate For Geosciences; Division Of Ocean Sciences [1635423] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Division Of Ocean Sciences; Directorate For Geosciences [1756623, 1756616] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","USDA: National Institute of Food and Agriculture(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)); NRSP-8 National Animal Genome Research Program; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Direct For Biological Sciences; Emerging Frontiers(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)); Direct For Biological Sciences; Emerging Frontiers(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)); Directorate For Geosciences; Division Of Ocean Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO)); Division Of Ocean Sciences; Directorate For Geosciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO))","This work was partially supported by the USDA: National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Hatch accession number 1017848 to H.M.P., NJ01180 to D.

Beyond its fundamental evolutionary implications, such knowledge can guide conservation decisions for populations of conservation and management concern. Here, we investigated the genomic basis of local adaptation in the Coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) across its entire North American range. We hypothesized that extensive spatial variation in environmental conditions and the species' homing behaviour may promote the establishment of local adaptation. We genotyped 7829 individuals representing 217 sampling locations at more than 100,000 high-quality RADseq loci to investigate how recombination might affect the detection of loci putatively under selection and took advantage of the precise description of the demographic history of the species from our previous work to draw accurate population genomic inferences about local adaptation. The results indicated that genetic differentiation scans and genetic-environment association analyses were both significantly affected by variation in recombination rate as low recombination regions displayed an increased number of outliers. By taking these confounding factors into consideration, we revealed that migration distance was the primary selective factor driving local adaptation and partial parallel divergence among distant populations. Moreover, we identified several candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with long-distance migration and altitude including a gene known to be involved in adaptation to altitude in other species. The evolutionary implications of our findings are discussed along with conservation applications.","[Rougemont, Quentin; Xuereb, Amanda; Dallaire, Xavier; Moore, Jean-Sebastien; Normandeau, Eric; Bernatchez, Louis] Univ Laval, Dept Biol, Inst Biol Integrat & Syst IBIS, Quebec City, PQ, Canada; [Rougemont, Quentin] Univ Paul Valery Montpellier, Ctr Ecol Fonct & Evolut, Univ Montpellier, CEFE,UMR 5175,CNRS,EPHE,IRD, Montpellier, France; [Rondeau, Eric B.; Withler, Ruth E.; Beacham, Terry D.] Pacific Biol Stn, Dept Fisheries & Ocean, Nanaimo, BC, Canada; [Rondeau, Eric B.; Koop, Ben F.] Univ Victoria, Dept Biol, Victoria, BC, Canada; [Van Doornik, Donald M.] Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, NOAA, Northwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Manchester Res Stn, Port Orchard, WA USA; [Crane, Penelope A.] US Fish & Wildlife Serv, Conservat Genet Lab, Anchorage, AK USA; [Naish, Kerry A.] Univ Washington, Sch Aquat & Fishery Sci, Seattle, WA USA; [Garza, John Carlos] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Ocean Sci, Santa Cruz, CA USA; [Garza, John Carlos] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Inst Marine Sci, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA","Laval University; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Ecology & Environment (INEE); Universite PSL; Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes (EPHE); Institut Agro; Montpellier SupAgro; CIRAD; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Universite Paul-Valery; Universite de Montpellier; Fisheries & Oceans Canada; University of Victoria; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; United States Department of the Interior; US Fish & Wildlife Service; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; University of California System; University of California Santa Cruz; University of California System; University of California Santa Cruz","Rougemont, Q (corresponding author), Univ Paul Valery Montpellier, Ctr Ecol Fonct & Evolut, Univ Montpellier, CEFE,UMR 5175,CNRS,EPHE,IRD, Montpellier, France.","quentinrougemont@orange.fr","; Dallaire, Xavier/ABA-2785-2022; Koop, Ben/A-8151-2008; Naish, Kerry-Ann/F-5768-2014","Bernatchez, Louis/0000-0002-8085-9709; Bougas, Berenice/0000-0003-4319-9016; Normandeau, Eric/0000-0003-2841-9391; Moore, Jean-Sebastien/0000-0002-3353-3730; Rougemont, Quentin/0000-0003-2987-3801; Dallaire, Xavier/0000-0003-2375-561X; Koop, Ben/0000-0003-0045-5200; , Donald M.

Only 229 of these could be annotated using available mass spectral libraries, but by applying new in silico annotation tools, characterization was expanded to 2710 features. The metabolomes of the Pseudo-nitzschia-microbiome associations were distinct and distinguished by structurally diverse nitrogen compounds, ranging from simple amines and amides to cyclic compounds such as imidazoles, pyrrolidines and lactams.

The corresponding O-polysaccharides (O-PS) of these strains are formed by identical trisaccharide repeats composed of l-Rhamnose (l-Rha), 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-l-fucose (l-FucNAc) and 2-acetamido-4-R-1-2,4-dideoxy-d-quinovose (d-Qui2NAc4NR(1)) where R-1 represents a dihydroxyhexanamido moiety. The O-PS loci of these strains are also identical except for the gene (wzy1 or wzy2) that encodes the polysaccharide polymerase. Accordingly, adjacent O-PS repeats are joined through d-Qui2NAc4NR1 and l-Rha by wzy2-dependent alpha(1-2) linkages in Fp CSF259-93 versus wzy1-dependent beta(1-3) linkages in Fp 950106-1/1. mAb FL100A reacted strongly with Fp CSF259-93 O-PS and LPS but weakly or not at all with Fp 950106-1/1 LPS and O-PS. Importantly, it also labelled cell surface blebs on the former but not the latter strain. Additionally, mAb binding was approximately 5-times stronger to homologous Fp CSF259-93 LPS than to LPS from a strain with a different R-group gene. A conformational epitope for mAb FL100A binding was suggested from molecular dynamic simulations of each O-PS. Thus, Fp CSF259-93 O-PS formed a stable well-defined compact helix in which the R1 groups were displayed in a regular pattern on the helix exterior while unreactive Fp 950106-1/1 O-PS adopted a flexible extended linear conformation. Taken together, the findings establish the specificity of mAb FL100A for Wzy2-linked F. psychrophilum O-PS and LPS.","[Cisar, John O.; Wiens, Gregory D.] USD ARS, Natl Ctr Cool & Cold Water Aquaculture, Kearneysville, WV 25430 USA; [Wang, Xiaocong] Huazhong Agr Univ, Coll Informat, Hubei Key Lab Agr Bioinformat, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Wang, Xiaocong; Woods, Robert J.] Univ Georgia, Complex Carbohydrate Res Ctr, Athens, GA USA; [Cain, Kenneth D.] Univ Idaho, Dept Fish & Wildlife Resources, Moscow, ID USA; [Cain, Kenneth D.] Univ Idaho, Aquaculture Res Inst, Moscow, ID USA; [Cain, Kenneth D.] NOAA Fisheries, Manchester Res Stn, Northwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Port Orchard, WA USA","Huazhong Agricultural University; University System of Georgia; University of Georgia; University of Idaho; University of Idaho; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA","Cisar, JO (corresponding author), USD ARS, Natl Ctr Cool & Cold Water Aquaculture, Kearneysville, WV 25430 USA.","john.cisar@usda.gov","CAIN, KEN/ABC-2818-2020; Woods, Robert/F-4962-2015","Wiens, Gregory/0000-0002-5478-7780; Woods, Robert/0000-0002-2400-6293","National Institutes of Health; NIDCR, NIH","National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); NIDCR, NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Dental & Craniofacial Research (NIDCR))","We thank Keira Osbourn for assistance in experiments and NIDCR, NIH for IT support.",NA,28,1,1,2,2,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","0140-7775","1365-2761","","J FISH DIS","J.

As in other vertebrates, growth in fish is regulated by the growth hormone (Gh)/insulin-like growth factor-1 (Igf1) endocrine axis, and changes in food intake impact growth via alterations to Gh/Igf1 signaling. Understanding the time course by which the Gh/ Igf1 axis responds to food consumption is crucial to predict how rapidly changes in food abundance might lead to altered growth dynamics. Here, we looked at the response times of plasma Igf1 and liver Igf1 signaling-associated gene expression to refeeding after food deprivation in juvenile gopher rockfish (Sebastes carnatus), one of several species of northern Pacific Ocean Sebastes rockfishes targeted by fisheries or utilized for aquaculture. Gopher rockfish were fasted for 30 d, after which a subset was fed to satiation for 2 h, while other rockfish continued to be fasted. Refed fish exhibited higher hepatosomatic index (HSI) values and increased Igf1 after food consumption. Gene transcripts for Gh receptor 1 (ghr1), but not ghr2, increased in the liver 2-4 d after eating. Transcripts encoding igf1also increased in the liver of refed fish by 4 d after feeding, only to return to levels similar as continually fasted rockfish by 9 d after feeding. Liver mRNA abundances for Igf binding protein (Igfbp) genes igfbp1a, igfbp1b, and igfbp3a declined within 2 d of feeding. These findings provide evidence that circulating Igf1 in rockfish reflects a fish's feeding experience within the previous few days, and suggest that feedinginduced increases in Igf1 are being mediated in part by altered liver sensitivity to Gh due to upregulated Gh receptor 1 expression.","[Mapes, Hayley M.; Lema, Sean C.] Calif Polytech State Univ San Luis Obispo, Ctr Coastal Marine Sci, Biol Sci Dept, San Luis Obispo, CA 93407 USA; [Journey, Meredith L.] Lynker Technol, 202 Church St SE 536, Leesburg, VA 20175 USA; [Beckman, Brian R.] NOAA, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Northwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Environm & Fisheries Sci Div, Seattle, WA 98112 USA; [Journey, Meredith L.] NOAA, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Northwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Contract Environm & Fisheries Sci Div, Seattle, WA 98112 USA; [Journey, Meredith L.] Univ Wyoming, Dept Zool & Physiol, Wyoming Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, Laramie, WY USA","California State University System; California Polytechnic State University San Luis Obispo; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of Wyoming","Lema, SC (corresponding author), Calif Polytech State Univ San Luis Obispo, Ctr Coastal Marine Sci, Biol Sci Dept, San Luis Obispo, CA 93407 USA.","slema@calpoly.edu","","Lema, Sean/0000-0002-2564-8992","California Sea Grant [R/HCME-15]; Santa Rosa Creek Foundation; American Fisheries Society (AFS) Cal-Neva Chapter","California Sea Grant; Santa Rosa Creek Foundation; American Fisheries Society (AFS) Cal-Neva Chapter","This research was supported by California Sea Grant (R/HCME-15) , with additional generous funding provided by a Santa Rosa Creek Foundation Graduate Fellowship to H.M.M., and a Small Project Grant from the American Fisheries Society (AFS) Cal-Neva Chapter to T.V.B.",NA,98,3,3,3,4,"ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC","NEW YORK","STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA","1095-6433","1531-4332","","COMP BIOCHEM PHYS A","Comp.

In the case of Cetacea (whales, dolphins, and porpoises), molecular phylogenies provide unambiguous evidence that fully aquatic cetaceans and semiaquatic hippopotamids (hippos) are each other's closest living relatives. Ancestral reconstructions suggest that some adaptations to the aquatic realm evolved in the common ancestor of Cetancodonta (Cetacea + Hippopotamidae). An alternative hypothesis is that these adaptations evolved independently in cetaceans and hippos. Here, we focus on the integumentary system and evaluate these hypotheses by integrating new histological data for cetaceans and hippos, the first genome-scale data for pygmy hippopotamus, and comprehensive genomic screens and molecular evolutionary analyses for protein-coding genes that have been inactivated in hippos and cetaceans. We identified eight skin-related genes that are inactivated in both cetaceans and hippos, including genes that are related to sebaceous glands, hair follicles, and epidermal differentiation. However, none of these genes exhibit inactivating mutations that are shared by cetaceans and hippos. Mean dates for the inactivation of skin genes in these two clades serve as proxies for phenotypic changes and suggest that hair reduction/loss, the loss of sebaceous glands, and changes to the keratinization program occurred similar to 16 Ma earlier in cetaceans (similar to 46.5 Ma) than in hippos (similar to 30.5 Ma). These results, together with histological differences in the integument and prior analyses of oxygen isotopes from stem hippopotamids (anthracotheres''), support the hypothesis that aquatic skin adaptations evolved independently in hippos and cetaceans.","[Springer, Mark S.;

In particular, restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (RAD-Seq) is being extensively applied to explore sex determination systems in many plant and animal species. However, software specifically designed to search for and visualize sex-biased markers using RAD-Seq data is lacking. Here, we present RADSex, a computational analysis workflow designed to study the genetic basis of sex determination using RAD-Seq data. RADSex is simple to use, requires few computational resources, makes no prior assumptions about the type of sex-determination system or structure of the sex locus, and offers convenient visualization through a dedicated R package. To demonstrate the functionality of RADSex, we re-analysed a published data set of Japanese medaka, Oryzias latipes, where we uncovered a previously unknown Y chromosome polymorphism. We then used RADSex to analyse new RAD-Seq data sets from 15 fish species spanning multiple taxonomic orders. We identified the sex determination system and sex-specific markers in six of these species, five of which had no known sex-markers prior to this study. We show that RADSex greatly facilitates the study of sex determination systems in nonmodel species thanks to its speed of analyses, low resource usage, ease of application and visualization options. Furthermore, our analysis of new data sets from 15 species provides new insights on sex determination in fish.","[Feron, Romain; Pan, Qiaowei; Wen, Ming; Imarazene, Boudjema; Jouanno, Elodie; Anderson, Jennifer;

Coexisting salmonid fish populations are known from over 100 freshwater lakes. Most studies of sympatric populations have used limited numbers of genetic markers making it unclear if genetic divergence involves certain parts of the genome. We returned to the first reported case of salmonid sympatry, initially detected through contrasting homozygosity at a single allozyme locus (coding for lactate dehydrogenase A) in brown trout in the small Lakes Bunnersjoarna, Sweden. First, we verified the existence of the two coexisting demes using a 96-SNP fluidigm array. We then applied whole-genome resequencing of pooled DNA to explore genome-wide diversity within and between these demes; nucleotide diversity was higher in deme I than in deme II. Strong genetic divergence is observed with genome-wide F-ST approximate to 0.2. Compared with data from populations of similar small lakes, this divergence is of similar magnitude as that between reproductively isolated populations. Individual whole-genome resequencing of two individuals per deme suggests higher inbreeding in deme II versus deme I, indicating different degree of isolation. We located two gene-copies for LDH-A and found divergence between demes in a regulatory section of one of these genes. However, we did not find a perfect fit between the sequence data and previous allozyme results, and this will require further research. Our data demonstrates genome-wide divergence governed mostly by genetic drift but also by diversifying selection in coexisting populations. This type of hidden biodiversity needs consideration in conservation management.","[Saha, Atal; Andersson, Anastasia; Kurland, Sara; Keehnen, Naomi L.

The decision to migrate is known to be highly heritable, and yet, the underlying genes and alleles associated with migration are not fully characterized. Here we used a pooled approach of whole-genome sequence data from migratory and resident trout of two native populations-Sashin Creek, Alaska and Little Sheep Creek, Oregon-to obtain a genome-wide perspective of the genetic architecture of resident and migratory life history. We calculated estimates of genetic differentiation, genetic diversity, and selection between the two phenotypes to locate regions of interest and then compared these associations between populations. We identified numerous genes and alleles associated with life history development in the Sashin Creek population with a notable area on chromosome 8 that may play a critical role in the development of the migratory phenotype. However, very few alleles appeared to be associated with life history development in the Little Sheep Creek system, suggesting population-specific genetic effects are likely important in the development of anadromy. Our results indicate that a migratory life history is not controlled by a singular gene or region but supports the idea that there are many independent ways for a migratory phenotype to emerge in a population. Therefore, conserving and promoting genetic diversity in migratory individuals is paramount to conserving these populations. Ultimately, our data add to a growing body of literature that suggests that population-specific genetic effects, likely mediated through environmental variation, contribute to life history development in rainbow trout.","[Clare, Catherine I.

The ecological success of these species depends on their ability to survive periods of food deprivation in a highly seasonal environment, but the molecular changes that mediate starvation tolerance in these taxa are unknown. We conducted starvation experiments for two dominant Southern Ocean copepods, Calanoides acutus and Calanus propinquus, allowing us to compare the molecular starvation response between species. These species differ in life history, diet and metabolic traits, and expressed overlapping but distinct transcriptomic responses to starvation. Most starvation-response genes were species-specific, but we identified a conserved core set of starvation-response genes related to RNA and protein metabolism. We used phylotranscriptomics to place these results in the context of copepod evolution and found that starvation-response genes are under strong purifying selection at the sequence level and stabilizing selection at the expression level, consistent with their role in mediating essential biological functions. Selection on starvation-response genes was especially strong in our focal lipid-storing lineage relative to other copepod taxa, underscoring the significance of starvation tolerance for these species. We also found that certain key lipid enzymes (elongases and desaturases) have experienced diversification and positive selection in lipid-storing lineages, reflecting the unique lipid storage needs of these animals. Our results shed light on the molecular adaptations of high-latitude zooplankton to variable food conditions and suggest that starvation-response genes are under particularly strong sequence and expression constraints.","[Berger, Cory A.; Tarrant, Ann M.] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Biol Dept, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; [Berger, Cory A.] MIT WHOI Joint Program Oceanog Appl Ocean Sci & En, Woods Hole, MA USA; [Steinberg, Deborah K.] William & Mary, Virginia Inst Marine Sci, Gloucester Point, VA USA; [Copeman, Louise A.] NOAA, Alaska Fisheries Sci Ctr, Hatfield Marine Sci Ctr, Newport, OR USA; [Berger, Cory A.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA","Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution; William & Mary; Virginia Institute of Marine Science; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara","Berger, CA; Tarrant, AM (corresponding author), Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Biol Dept, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.;Berger, CA (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.","cberger@ucsb.edu; atarrant@whoi.edu","","Tarrant, Ann/0000-0002-1909-7899; Berger, Cory/0000-0002-6003-1955","Office of Polar Programs [OPP-1746087, OPP-1440435, OPP-2026045]; National Science Foundation Office of Polar Programs","Office of Polar Programs(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO)); National Science Foundation Office of Polar Programs(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO))","We thank Dr. Junya Hirai for generously providing sequencing data for Eucalanus bungii prior to public release, Dr. Leocadio Blanco-Bercial for advice and comments regarding the phylogenetic analysis, and Drs.

Sebastes rockfishes are commercially and ecologically important. This genus encompasses more than one hundred species and the ecological and morphological variance between these species provides opportunity for identifying speciation-driving adaptations, particularly along a depth gradient. A reduced-representation sequencing method (ddRADseq) was used to compare 95 individuals encompassing six Sebastes species. In this study, we sought to identify regions of divergence between species that were indicative of divergent adaptation and reproductive barriers leading to speciation. A pairwise comparison of S. chrysomelas (black-and-yellow rockfish) and S. carnatus (gopher rockfish) F-ST values revealed three major regions of elevated genomic divergence, two of which were also present in the S. miniatus (vermilion rockfish) and S. crocotulus (sunset rockfish) comparison. These corresponded with regions of both elevated D-XY values and reduced nucleotide diversity in two cases, suggesting a speciation-with-gene-flow evolutionary model followed by post-speciation selective sweeps within each species. Limited whole-genome resequencing was also performed to identify mutations with predicted effects between S. chrysomelas and S. carnatus. Within these islands, we identified important SNPs in genes involved in immune function and vision. This supports their potential role in speciation, as these are adaptive vectors noted in other organisms. Additionally, changes to genes involved in pigment expression and mate recognition shed light on how S. chrysomelas and S. carnatus may have become reproductively isolated.","[Behrens, Kristen A.; Girasek, Quinn L.; Buonaccorsi, Vincent P.] Juniata Coll, Dept Biol, Huntingdon, PA 16652 USA; [Sickler, Alex] Childrens Hosp Philadelphia, Ctr Data Driven Discovery Biomed, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Hyde, John] NOAA Fisheries, Fisheries Resources Div, Southwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, La Jolla, CA USA","University of Pennsylvania; Pennsylvania Medicine; Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA","Behrens, KA (corresponding author), Juniata Coll, Dept Biol, Huntingdon, PA 16652 USA.","kristenbehrens14@gmail.com","","Sickler, Alex/0000-0001-7830-7537; Girasek, Quinn/0000-0001-5687-8187; Behrens, Kristen/0000-0003-1895-3523","Howard Hughes Medical Institute; NSF [DBI-1248096]","Howard Hughes Medical Institute(Howard Hughes Medical Institute); NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF))","Howard Hughes Medical Institute; NSF, Grant/Award Number: #DBI-1248096",NA,91,9,12,3,34,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","0962-1083","1365-294X","","MOL ECOL","Mol.

Potential interactions between genetic and environmental variants associated with different migratory phenotypes are rarely the focus of study. We pair low coverage whole genome resequencing with a de novo genome assembly to examine population structure, inbreeding, and the environmental factors associated with genetic differentiation between migratory and resident breeding phenotypes in a species of conservation concern, the western burrowing owl (Athene cunicularia hypugaea). Our analyses reveal a dichotomy in gene flow depending on whether the population is resident or migratory, with the former being genetically structured and the latter exhibiting no signs of structure. Among resident populations, we observed significantly higher genetic differentiation, significant isolation-by-distance, and significantly elevated inbreeding. Among migratory breeding groups, on the other hand, we observed lower genetic differentiation, no isolation-by-distance, and substantially lower inbreeding. Using genotype-environment association analysis, we find significant evidence for relationships between migratory phenotypes (i.e., migrant versus resident) and environmental variation associated with cold temperatures during the winter and barren, open habitats. In the regions of the genome most differentiated between migrants and residents, we find significant enrichment for genes associated with the metabolism of fats. This may be linked to the increased pressure on migrants to process and store fats more efficiently in preparation for and during migration. Our results provide a significant contribution toward understanding the evolution of migratory behavior and vital insight into ongoing conservation and management efforts for the western burrowing owl.","[Barr, Kelly; Smith, Thomas B.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Inst Environm & Sustainabil, Ctr Trop Res, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Barr, Kelly; Smith, Thomas B.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Bossu, Christen M.; Ruegg, Kristen C.] Colorado State Univ, Dept Biol, Ft Collins, CO USA; [Bay, Rachael A.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Evolut & Ecol, Davis, CA USA; [Anderson, Eric C.] Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Southwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Fisheries Ecol Div, Santa Cruz, CA USA; [Anderson, Eric C.] Colorado State Univ, Dept Fish Wildlife & Conservat Biol, Ft Collins, CO USA; [Belthoff, Jim] Boise State Univ, Raptor Res Ctr, Boise, ID USA; [Belthoff, Jim] Boise State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Boise, ID USA; [Trulio, Lynne A.] San Jose State Univ, Dept Environm Studies, San Jose, CA USA; [Chromczak, Debra] Burrowing Owl Res & Consultant, Riegelsville, PA USA; [Wisinski, Colleen L.] San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance, Escondido, CA USA","University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; Colorado State University; University of California System; University of California Davis; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Colorado State University; Boise State University; Boise State University; California State University System; San Jose State University","Barr, K (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Inst Environm & Sustainabil, Ctr Trop Res, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.","kellybarr@gmail.com",", Tom Smtih/JXX-5281-2024","Barr, Kelly/0000-0001-9193-1094","We thank the many collaborators who provided samples, site access, and often a hand in the extensive fieldwork undertaken for this effort.

Here, we investigated the macro-and microevo-lutionary processes shaping genomic population structure and diversity in two poorly understood, globally distributed, deep-sea predators: Cuvier's beaked whale (Ziphius cavirostris) and Blain-ville's beaked whale (Mesoplodon densirostris). We used double-digest restriction associated DNA (ddRAD) and whole mitochondrial genome (mitogenome) sequencing to characterise genetic patterns using phylogenetic trees, cluster analysis, isolation-by-distance, genetic diversity and differentiation statistics. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs; Blainville's n = 43 samples, SNPs=13988; Cuvier's n = 123, SNPs= 30479) and mitogenomes (Blainville's n = 27; Cuvier's n = 35) revealed substantial hierarchical structure at a global scale. Both species display significant genetic structure between the Atlantic, Indo-Pacific and in Cuvier's, the Mediterranean Sea. Within major ocean basins, clear differentiation is found between genetic clusters on the east and west sides of the North Atlantic, and some distinct patterns of structure in the Indo-Pacific and Southern Hemisphere. We infer that macroevolutionary processes shaping patterns of genetic diversity include biogeographical barriers, highlighting the importance of such barriers even to highly mobile, deep-diving taxa. The barriers likely differ between the species due to their thermal tolerances and evolutionary histories. On a microevolutionary scale, it seems likely that the balance between resident populations displaying site fidelity, and transient individuals facilitating gene flow, shapes patterns of connectivity and genetic drift in beaked whales. Based on these results, we propose management units to facilitate improved conservation measures for these elusive species.","[Onoufriou, Aubrie B.; Montano, Valeria; Carroll, Emma L.] Univ St Andrews, Sch Biol, St Andrews, Fife, Scotland; [Onoufriou, Aubrie B.; de Soto, Natacha Aguilar; Suarez, Cristel Reyes; Schiavi, Agustina] Univ La Laguna, BIOECOMAC Dept Anim Biol Edaphol & Geol, Tenerife, Spain; [Gaggiotti, Oscar E.] Univ St Andrews, Sch Biol, Ctr Biol Divers, St Andrews, Fife, Scotland; [McCarthy, Morgan L.; Dreyer, Sascha; Hansen, Sabine S.; Olsen, Morten Tange] Univ Copenhagen, Globe Inst, Sect Mol Ecol & Evolut, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Morin, Phillip A.] NOAA, Southwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, La Jolla, CA USA; [Rosso, Massimiliano; Moulins, Aurelie; Tepsich, Paola] CIMA Res Fdn, Savona, Italy; [Dalebout, Merel] Univ New South Wales, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Davison, Nicholas; Brownlow, Andrew] Univ Glasgow, Coll Med Vet & Life Sci, Sch Biodivers 1 Hlth & Vet Med, Scottish Marine Anim Stranding Scheme, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland; [Baird, Robin W.] Cascadia Res Collect, Olympia, WA USA; [Baker, C.

Host susceptibility to pathogens can vary by species, demographics and genetics which affect epizootic and population dynamics, ultimately determining population trends and evolution. Chronic wasting disease (CWD), a fatal neuro-degenerative prion disease of cervids, has varying host susceptibility conferred by polymorphisms of the prion protein gene (PRNP) at codon 96 for white-tailed deer Odocoileus virginianus. Deer with the homozygous Glycine allele (96GG) are most susceptible and a single Serine allele (96GS/96SS) reduces the risk of infection and mortality. We developed epizootiological models that demonstrate CWD infection and disease-associated mortality were higher for the more susceptible (96GG) genotype; and, infection was higher for males than females. We used population models to evaluate future shifts in genotype frequencies under alternative harvest and infection rate scenarios. Genetic shifts towards less susceptible genotypes were predicted as CWD prevalence increased during the course of an outbreak. This further increased CWD prevalence, and likely environmental contamination from prion shedding, due to longer incubation periods. Alternative harvest management strategies directly influenced CWD prevalence and spread, the rate of genetic selection and deer population growth. Synthesis and applications. We show that chronic wasting disease (CWD) transmission varied by sex, age class and PRNP genotype, and that CWD disease-associated mortality varied by genotype. Together, these forces lead to CWD-mediated genetic selection for a white-tailed deer population. We predict that genetic selection pressure increases when hunter harvest pressure is lowered, and conversely, increasing hunter harvest can reduce genetic selection rates of antlered deer. Our results support the control of CWD prevalence by aggressive harvest of adult males, because they have the highest infection rates. Our results have strong implications for evolution, disease ecology, geographical spread, disease mitigation and cervid population management.","[Ketz, Alison C.] Univ Wisconsin, Wisconsin Cooperat Res Unit, Dept Forest & Wildlife Ecol, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Robinson, Stacie J.] NOAA, Hawaiian Monk Seal Res Program, Pacific Isl Fisheries Sci Ctr, Honolulu, HI USA; [Johnson, Chad J.] Univ Wisconsin, Med Microbiol & Immunol, Madison, WI USA; [Samuel, Michael D.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Forest & Wildlife Ecol, Madison, WI USA","University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison","Ketz, AC (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Wisconsin Cooperat Res Unit, Dept Forest & Wildlife Ecol, Madison, WI 53706 USA.","aketz@wisc.edu","","Samuel, Michael/0000-0002-4267-2724; Ketz, Alison/0000-0003-3980-2978","U.S. Department of Agriculture; Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources","U.S. Department of Agriculture(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)); Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources","U.S. Department of Agriculture; Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources",NA,94,5,6,3,30,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","0021-8901","1365-2664","","J APPL ECOL","J.

Samples were screened for the presence/absence of 15 select antibiotic resistance gene targets using the polymerase chain reaction. A contrast between seasons was found, with a higher frequency of detections occurring in the wet season and fewer during the dry season.

The haplotype network clearly recovered two haplotype groups, consisting of western and eastern North Pacific individuals, except for some specimens collected from offshore of Tohoku, northern Japan. The geographic distribution of haplotypes suggests that the ocean currents in the North Pacific have shaped the population structure of the species after historical vicariant events between the Kuril Islands and Kamchatka Peninsula. In addition, the demographic histories of the two haplotype groups were quite different, suggesting that the western North Pacific group experienced a population expansion starting around 10,000 years ago, while the population size of the eastern North Pacific group has remained more stable.","[Okazaki, Takumi; Yamashita, Yoh] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Global Environm Studies, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068502, Japan; [Stevenson, Duane E.] Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Alaska Fisheries Sci Ctr, Resource Assessment & Conservat Engn Div, 7600 Sand Point Way NE, Seattle, WA 98115 USA; [Kai, Yoshiaki] Kyoto Univ, Field Sci Educ & Res Ctr, Maizuru Fisheries Res Stn, Maizuru, Kyoto 6250086, Japan; [Ueda, Yuji] Japan Fisheries Res & Educ Agcy, Japan Sea Natl Fisheries Res Inst, Chuo Ku, 1-5939-22 Suido, Niigata 9518121, Japan; [Hamatsu, Tomonori] Japan Fisheries Res & Educ Agcy, Hokkaido Natl Fisheries Res Inst, 116 Katsura Koi, Kushiro, Hokkaido 0850802, Japan","Kyoto University; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Kyoto University; Japan Fisheries Research & Education Agency (FRA); Japan Fisheries Research & Education Agency (FRA)","Kai, Y (corresponding author), Kyoto Univ, Field Sci Educ & Res Ctr, Maizuru Fisheries Res Stn, Maizuru, Kyoto 6250086, Japan.","mebaru@kais.kyoto-u.ac.jp","Yamashita, Yoh/IYJ-3507-2023","KAI, Yoshiaki/0000-0002-0991-5173","","","",NA,41,4,5,0,9,"SPRINGER","NEW YORK","ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES","0378-1909","1573-5133","","ENVIRON BIOL FISH","Environ.

Here we present a multi-omics analysis of a diverse set of 880 microbial community samples collected for the Earth Microbiome Project. We include amplicon (16S, 18S, ITS) and shotgun metagenomic sequence data, and untargeted metabolomics data (liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and gas chromatography mass spectrometry). We used standardized protocols and analytical methods to characterize microbial communities, focusing on relationships and co-occurrences of microbially related metabolites and microbial taxa across environments, thus allowing us to explore diversity at extraordinary scale. In addition to a reference database for metagenomic and metabolomic data, we provide a framework for incorporating additional studies, enabling the expansion of existing knowledge in the form of an evolving community resource. We demonstrate the utility of this database by testing the hypothesis that every microbe and metabolite is everywhere but the environment selects. Our results show that metabolite diversity exhibits turnover and nestedness related to both microbial communities and the environment, whereas the relative abundances of microbially related metabolites vary and co-occur with specific microbial consortia in a habitat-specific manner. We additionally show the power of certain chemistry, in particular terpenoids, in distinguishing Earth's environments (for example, terrestrial plant surfaces and soils, freshwater and marine animal stool), as well as that of certain microbes including Conexibacter woesei (terrestrial soils), Haloquadratum walsbyi (marine deposits) and Pantoea dispersa (terrestrial plant detritus). This Resource provides insight into the taxa and metabolites within microbial communities from diverse habitats across Earth, informing both microbial and chemical ecology, and provides a foundation and methods for multi-omics microbiome studies of hosts and the environment.","[Shaffer, Justin P.;

In this study, we compared the genomic and physiological response of diploid (2n) and triploid (3n) Pacific oysters (Crassostrea gigas) to conditions present during an atmospheric heatwave that impacted the Pacific Northwestern region of the United States in the summer of 2021. Climate stressors were applied either singly (single stressor; elevated seawater temperature, 30?) or in succession (multiple stressor; elevated seawater temperature followed by aerial emersion at 44?), replicating conditions present within the intertidal over a tidal cycle during the event. Oyster mortality rate was elevated within stress treatments with respect to the control and was significantly higher in triploids than diploids following multiple stress exposure (36.4% vs. 14.8%). Triploids within the multiple stressor treatment exhibited signs of energetic limitation, including metabolic depression, a significant reduction in ctenidium Na+/K+ ATPase activity, and the dysregulated expression of genes associated with stress response, innate immunity, glucose metabolism, and mitochondrial function. Functional enrichment analysis of ploidy-specific gene sets identified that biological processes associated with metabolism, stress tolerance, and immune function were overrepresented within triploids across stress treatments. Our results suggest that triploidy impacts the transcriptional regulation of key processes that underly the stress response of Pacific oysters, resulting in downstream shifts in physiological tolerance limits that may increase susceptibility to extreme climate events that present multiple environmental stressors. The impact of chromosome set manipulation on the climate resilience of marine organisms has important implications for domestic food security within future climate scenarios, especially as triploidy induction becomes an increasingly popular tool to elicit reproductive control across a wide range of species used within marine aquaculture.","[George, Matthew N.; Cattau, Olivia; Lawson, Delaney; Vadopalas, Brent; Roberts, Steven B.] Univ Washington, Sch Aquat & Fishery Sci, Seattle, WA USA; [George, Matthew N.; Middleton, Mollie A.; Gavery, Mackenzie] NOAA, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Northwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Environm & Fisheries Sci Div, Seattle, WA USA; [Middleton, Mollie A.] Saltwater Inc, Anchorage, AK USA; [George, Matthew N.] Univ Washington, Sch Aquat & Fishery Sci, 1122 NE Boat St, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle","George, MN (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Sch Aquat & Fishery Sci, 1122 NE Boat St, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.","mattgeorgephd@gmail.com","; George, Matthew/M-8748-2018","Roberts, Steven/0000-0001-8302-1138; George, Matthew/0000-0003-1264-8667; Cattau, Olivia/0000-0001-6028-3928; Gavery, Mackenzie/0000-0001-5010-3399","National Oceanographic Partnership Program (IWG- NOPP)","National Oceanographic Partnership Program (IWG- NOPP)","National Oceanographic Partnership Program (IWG- NOPP)",NA,125,5,5,5,24,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","1354-1013","1365-2486","","GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL","Glob.

Freshwater fisheries exemplify this problem, with many populations supported by multiple stocks of young evolutionary age and isolated across small spatial scales. Consequently, attempts to conduct genetic mixed-stock analyses of inland fisheries have often been unsuccessful. Advances in genomic sequencing offer the ability to discriminate among populations with weak population structure, providing the necessary resolution to conduct mixed-stock assignment among previously indistinguishable stocks. We used genomic data to conduct a mixed-stock analysis of eastern Lake Erie's commercial and recreational walleye (Sander vitreus) fisheries and estimate the relative harvest of weakly differentiated stocks (pairwise F-ST < 0.01). Using RAD-capture (Rapture), we sequenced and genotyped individuals from western and eastern basin local spawning stocks at 12,081 loci with 95% reassignment accuracy, which was not possible in the past using microsatellite markers. A baseline assessment of 395 walleye from 11 spawning stocks identified three reporting groups and refined previous assessments of gene flow among walleye stocks. Genetic assignment of 1,075 walleye harvested in eastern Lake Erie's recreational and commercial fisheries indicated that western basin stocks constituted the majority of harvest during the peak walleye fishing season (July-September), whereas eastern basin individuals comprised much of the early season harvest (May-June). Clear spatial structure in harvest composition existed; catches in more easterly sites contained more individuals of eastern basin origin than did more westerly sites. Our study provides important stock contribution estimates for Lake Erie fishery management and demonstrates the utility of genomic data to facilitate mixed-stock analysis in exploited fish populations having weak population structure or limited existing genetic resources.","[Euclide, Peter T.] Univ Wisconsin, Coll Nat Resources, Wisconsin Cooperat Fishery Res Unit, 800 Reserve St, Stevens Point, WI 54481 USA; [MacDougall, Tom] Ontario Minist Nat Resources & Forestry, Lake Erie Management Unit, Port Dover, ON, Canada; [Robinson, Jason M.] New York State Dept Environm Conservat, Lake Erie Fisheries Res Unit, Dunkirk, NY USA; [Faust, Matthew D.] Ohio Dept Nat Resources, Div Wildlife, Sandusky Fisheries Res Stn, Sandusky, OH USA; [Wilson, Chris C.] Ontario Minist Nat Resources & Forestry, Aquat Res & Monitoring Sect, Peterborough, ON, Canada; [Chen, Kuan-Yu; Marschall, Elizabeth A.; Ludsin, Stuart] Ohio State Univ, Dept Evolut Ecol & Organismal Biol, Aquat Ecol Lab, Columbus, OH 43212 USA; [Larson, Wesley] Univ Wisconsin, Coll Nat Resources, Wisconsin Cooperat Fishery Res Unit, US Geol Survey, Stevens Point, WI 54481 USA; [Larson, Wesley] NOAA, Ted Stevens Marine Res Inst, Juneau, AK USA","University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Stevens Point; Ministry of Natural Resources & Forestry; Ohio Department of Natural Resources; Ministry of Natural Resources & Forestry; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Stevens Point; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA","Euclide, PT (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Coll Nat Resources, Wisconsin Cooperat Fishery Res Unit, 800 Reserve St, Stevens Point, WI 54481 USA.;Ludsin, S (corresponding author), Ohio State Univ, Dept Evolut Ecol & Organismal Biol, Aquat Ecol Lab, Columbus, OH 43212 USA.","euclidep@uwm.edu; ludsin.1@osu.edu","Ludsin, Stuart/F-2925-2010; Wilson, Chris/J-4851-2012; Marschall, Elizabeth/A-1608-2014","Euclide, Peter/0000-0002-1212-0435; Larson, Wesley/0000-0003-4473-3401; Wilson, Chris/0000-0002-9528-0652; Marschall, Elizabeth/0000-0002-8026-4203","Ohio Sea Grant College Program, The Ohio State University [NA14OAR4170067, GRT00033622]","Ohio Sea Grant College Program, The Ohio State University","Ohio Sea Grant College Program, The Ohio State University, Grant/Award Number: NA14OAR4170067 and GRT00033622",NA,102,17,18,1,11,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","1752-4571","","","EVOL APPL","Evol.

SCTLD emerged off the coast of South Florida in 2014 and has since moved into the Caribbean, resulting in coral mortality rates that have changed reef structure and function. Currently, the cause of SCTLD is unknown, but there is evidence from 16S rRNA gene sequencing and bacterial culture studies that the microbial community plays a role in the progression of SCTLD lesions. In this study, we applied shotgun metagenomics to characterize the potential function of bacteria, as well as the composition of the micro-eukaryotic community, associated with SCTLD lesions. We re-examined samples that were previously analyzed using 16S rRNA gene high-throughput sequencing from four coral species: Stephanocoenia intersepta, Diploria labyrinthiformis, Dichocoenia stokesii, and Meandrina meandrites. For each species, tissue from apparently healthy (AH) corals, and unaffected tissue (DU) and lesion tissue (DL) on diseased corals, were collected from sites within the epidemic zone of SCTLD in the Florida Keys. Within the micro-eukaryotic community, the taxa most prominently enriched in DL compared to AH and DU tissue were members of Ciliophora. We also found that DL samples were relatively more abundant in less energy-efficient pathways like the pentose phosphate pathways. While less energy-efficient processes were identified, there were also relatively higher abundances of nucleotide biosynthesis and peptidoglycan maturation pathways in diseased corals compared to AH, which suggests there was more bacteria growth in diseased colonies. In addition, we generated 16 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) belonging to the orders Pseudomonadales, Beggiatoales, Rhodobacterales, Rhizobiales, Rs-D84, Flavobacteriales, and Campylobacterales, and all MAGs were enriched in DL samples compared to AH samples. Across all MAGs there were antibiotic resistance genes that may have implications for the treatment of SCTLD with antibiotics. We also identified genes and pathways linked to virulence, such as nucleotide biosynthesis, succinate dehydrogenase, ureases, nickel/iron transporters, Type-1 secretion system, and metalloproteases. Some of these enzymes/pathways have been previously targeted in the treatment of other bacterial diseases and they may be of interest to mitigate SCTLD lesion progression.","[Rosales, Stephanie M.] Univ Miami, Cooperat Inst Marine & Atmospher Studies, Miami, FL 33146 USA; [Rosales, Stephanie M.] Natl Ocean & Atmospher Adm, Atlantic Oceanog & Meteorol Lab, Miami, FL 33149 USA; [Huebner, Lindsay K.; Ruzicka, Rob R.] Fish & Wildlife Res Inst, Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservat Commiss, St Petersburg, FL 33701 USA; [Clark, Abigail S.] Elizabeth Moore Int Ctr Coral Reef Res & Restorat, Mote Marine Lab, Summerland Key, FL 33042 USA; [McMinds, Ryan] Univ S Florida, Ctr Global Hlth & Infect Dis Res, Tampa, FL 33620 USA; [Muller, Erinn M.] Mote Marine Lab & Aquarium, Sarasota, FL 34236 USA","University of Miami; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Atlantic Oceanographic & Meteorological Laboratory (AOML); Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservation Commission; Mote Marine Laboratory & Aquarium; State University System of Florida; University of South Florida; Mote Marine Laboratory & Aquarium","Rosales, SM (corresponding author), Univ Miami, Cooperat Inst Marine & Atmospher Studies, Miami, FL 33146 USA.;Rosales, SM (corresponding author), Natl Ocean & Atmospher Adm, Atlantic Oceanog & Meteorol Lab, Miami, FL 33149 USA.","Stephanie.Rosales@NOAA.gov","Huebner, Lindsay/AAI-9558-2020; Rosales, Stephanie/Z-4923-2019; McMinds, Ryan/ADX-1262-2022","McMinds, Ryan/0000-0001-6333-6845; Huebner, Lindsay/0000-0003-0413-9408","","","",NA,90,15,17,0,22,"FRONTIERS MEDIA SA","LAUSANNE","AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND","","2296-7745","","FRONT MAR SCI","Front.

Such high temperature inhibition of reproduction comes about in part from altered stimulation of gametogenesis by the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) endocrine axis. Elevated temperatures have also been shown to affect thyroid hormone (TH) signaling, and altered TH status under high temperatures may impact gametogenesis via crosstalk with HPG axis pathways. Here, we examined effects of temperature and 3'-triiodo-Lthyronine (T3) on pathways for gonadal steroidogenesis and gametogenesis in Amargosa pupfish (Cyprinodon nevadensis amargosae) from two allopatric populations: 1) the Amargosa River - a highly variable temperature habitat, and 2) Tecopa Bore - an invariably warm groundwater-fed marsh. These populations were previously shown to differ in TH signaling profiles both in the wild and under common laboratory conditions. Sexuallymature pupfish from each population were maintained at 24 degrees C or 34 degrees C for 88 days, after which a subset of fish was treated with T3 for 18-24 h. In both populations, mRNA abundances for follicle-stimulating hormone receptor and luteinizing hormone receptor were higher in the ovary and testis at 24 degrees C compared to 34 degrees C. Females from Tecopa Bore - but not from the Amargosa River - also had greater ovarian transcript abundances for steroidogenic enzymes cytochrome P450 aromatase, 38-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, and 178-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase at 24 degrees C compared to 34 degrees C, as well as higher liver mRNA levels of vitellogenins and choriogenins at cooler temperature. Transcript abundances for estrogen receptors esr1, esr2a, and esr2b were reduced at 34 degrees C in Amargosa River females, but not in Tecopa Bore females. T3 augmented gonadal gene transcript levels for steroid acute regulatory protein (StAR) transporter in both sexes and populations. T3 also downregulated liver estrogen receptor mRNAs in females from the warmer Tecopa Bore habitat only, suggesting T3 modulation of liver E2 sensitivity as a possible mechanism whereby temperature-induced changes in TH status may contribute to shifts in thermal sensitivity for oogenesis.","[Lema, Sean C.; Chow, Michelle I.; Housh, Madeline J.] Calif Polytech State Univ San Luis Obispo, Ctr Coastal Marine Sci, Biol Sci Dept, San Luis Obispo, CA 93407 USA; [Dittman, Andrew H.] NOAA, Northwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Environm & Fisheries Sci Div, Seattle, WA USA; [May, Darran] Univ Washington, Aquat & Fishery Sci, Seattle, WA USA","California State University System; California Polytechnic State University San Luis Obispo; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle","Lema, SC (corresponding author), Calif Polytech State Univ San Luis Obispo, Ctr Coastal Marine Sci, Biol Sci Dept, San Luis Obispo, CA 93407 USA.","slema@calpoly.edu","","Lema, Sean/0000-0002-2564-8992","California State University (CSU) Program for Education and Research in Biotechnology (CSUPERB) Development Grant; Cal Poly College Based Fees (CBF)","California State University (CSU) Program for Education and Research in Biotechnology (CSUPERB) Development Grant; Cal Poly College Based Fees (CBF)","This research was funded by a California State University (CSU) Program for Education and Research in Biotechnology (CSUPERB) Development Grant to S.C.L., and by Cal Poly College Based Fees (CBF) funding to M.I.C.

However, although the higher-level relationships among cetacean families have been largely settled, several aspects of the systematics within these groups remain unresolved. Problematic clades include the oceanic dolphins (37 spp.), which have experienced a recent rapid radiation, and the beaked whales (22 spp.), which have not been investigated in detail using nuclear loci. The combined application of high-throughput sequencing with techniques that target specific genomic sequences provide a powerful means of rapidly generating large volumes of orthologous sequence data for use in phylogenomic studies. To elucidate the phylogenetic relationships within the Cetacea, we combined sequence capture with Illumina sequencing to generate data for 3200 protein-coding genes for 68 cetacean species and their close relatives including the pygmy hippopotamus. By combining data from 38,000 exons with existing sequences from 11 cetaceans and seven outgroup taxa, we produced the first comprehensive comparative genomic data set for cetaceans, spanning 6,527,596 aligned base pairs (bp) and 89 taxa. Phylogenetic trees reconstructed with maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference of concatenated loci, as well as with coalescence analyses of individual gene trees, produced mostly concordant and well-supported trees. Our results completely resolve the relationships among beaked whales as well as the contentious relationships among oceanic dolphins, especially the problematic subfamily Delphinidae. We carried out Bayesian estimation of species divergence times using MCMCTree and compared our complete data set to a subset of clocklike genes. Analyses using the complete data set consistently showed less variance in divergence times than the reduced data set. In addition, integration of new fossils (e.g., Mystacodon selenensis) indicates that the diversification of Crown Cetacea began before the Late Eocene and the divergence of Crown Delphinidae as early as the Middle Miocene.","[McGowen, Michael R.; Tsagkogeorga, Georgia; Alvarez-Carretero, Sandra; dos Reis, Mario; Struebig, Monika; Rossiter, Stephen J.] Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Biol & Chem Sci, Mile End Rd, London E1 4NS, England; [McGowen, Michael R.] Smithsonian Museum Nat Hist, Dept Vertebrate Zool, 10th & Constitut Ave NW, Washington, DC 20560 USA; [Deaville, Robert; Jepson, Paul D.] Zool Soc London, Inst Zool, Outer Circle, London NW1 4RY, England; [Jarman, Simon] Univ Western Australia, Sch Biol Sci, 35 Stirling Highway, Perth, WA 6009, Australia; [Polanowski, Andrea] Australian Antarctic Div, 203 Channel Highway, Kingston, Tas 7050, Australia; [Morin, Phillip A.] NOAA, Southwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, 8901 La Jolla Shores Dr, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA","University of London; Queen Mary University London; Smithsonian Institution; Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History; Zoological Society of London; University of Western Australia; Australian Antarctic Division; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA","Rossiter, SJ (corresponding author), Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Biol & Chem Sci, Mile End Rd, London E1 4NS, England.","s.j.rossiter@qmul.ac.uk","Morin, Phillip/E-9515-2010; Rossiter, Stephen/E-2111-2011; dos Reis, Mario/B-4938-2009","Alvarez-Carretero, Sandra/0000-0002-9508-6286; Polanowski, Andrea/0000-0002-9612-220X; Rossiter, Stephen/0000-0002-3881-4515; dos Reis, Mario/0000-0001-9514-3976","Royal Society Newton International Fellowship; European Research Council Starting grant [310482]; European Research Council (ERC) [310482] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC)","Royal Society Newton International Fellowship(Royal Society); European Research Council Starting grant(European Research Council (ERC)); European Research Council (ERC)","This research was funded by a Royal Society Newton International Fellowship to M.R.M. and S.J.R. and a European Research Council Starting grant (310482, EVOGENO) awarded to S.J.R.",NA,131,143,153,8,95,"OXFORD UNIV PRESS","OXFORD","GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","1063-5157","1076-836X","","SYST BIOL","Syst.

Their life history traits (slow growth, late maturity, low reproductive output) make them vulnerable to perturbations and therefore require informed management strategies. Previous studies have reported wide-spread genetic connectivity along continental shelves suggesting high gene flow along continuous habitats spanning hundreds of kilometers. However, in the Hawaiian Islands, tagging and photo-identification evidence suggest island populations are isolated despite proximity, a hypothesis that has not yet been evaluated with genetic data. Results This island-resident hypothesis was tested by analyzing whole mitogenome haplotypes and 2048 nuclear single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) between M. alfredi (n = 38) on HawaiModified Letter Turned Commai Island and Maui Nui (the 4-island complex of Maui, MolokaModified Letter Turned Commai, LanaModified Letter Turned Commai and KahoModified Letter Turned Commaolawe). Strong divergence in the mitogenome (phi(ST) = 0.488) relative to nuclear genome-wide SNPs (neutral F-ST = 0.003; outlier F-ST = 0.186), and clustering of mitochondrial haplotypes among islands provides robust evidence that female reef manta rays are strongly philopatric and do not migrate between these two island groups. Combined with restricted male-mediated migration, equivalent to a single male moving between islands every 2.2 generations (similar to 64 years), we provide evidence these populations are significantly demographically isolated. Estimates of contemporary effective population size (N-e) are 104 (95% CI: 99-110) in HawaiModified Letter Turned Commai Island and 129 (95% CI: 122-136) in Maui Nui. Conclusions Concordant with evidence from photo identification and tagging studies, these genetic results indicate reef manta rays in HawaiModified Letter Turned Commai have small, genetically-isolated resident island populations. We hypothesize that due to the Island Mass Effect, large islands provide sufficient resources to support resident populations, thereby making crossing deep channels separating island groups unnecessary. Small effective population size, low genetic diversity, and k-selected life history traits make these isolated populations vulnerable to region-specific anthropogenic threats, which include entanglement, boat strikes, and habitat degradation. The long-term persistence of reef manta rays in the Hawaiian Islands will require island-specific management strategies.","[Whitney, Jonathan L.

Periods of apparent dormancy have punctuated smaller and more geographically-restricted outbreaks in 2007, 2008, and 2017. In this study, we conduct the largest whole genome sequencing analysis of VHSV-IVb to date, evaluating its evolutionary changes from 48 isolates in relation to immunogenicity in cell culture. Our investigation compares genomic and genetic variation, selection, and rates of sequence changes in VHSV-IVb, in relation to other VHSV genogroups (VHSV-I, VHSV-II, VHSV-III, and VHSV-IVa) and with other Novirhabdoviruses. Results show that the VHSV-IVb isolates we sequenced contain 253 SNPs (2.3% of the total 11,158 nucleotides) across their entire genomes, with 85 (33.6%) of them being non-synonymous. The most substitutions occurred in the non-coding region (NCDS; 4.3%), followed by the Nv- (3.8%), and M- (2.8%) genes. Proportionally more M-gene substitutions encoded amino acid changes (52.9%), followed by the Nv- (50.0%), G- (48.6%), N- (35.7%) and L- (23.1%) genes. Among VHSV genogroups and subgenogroups, VHSV-IVa from the northeastern Pacific Ocean has shown the fastest substitution rate (2.01x10(-3)), followed by VHSV-IVb (6.64x10(-5)) and by the VHSV-I, -II and-III genogroups from Europe (4.09x10(-5)). A 2016 gizzard shad (Dorosoma cepedianum) from Lake Erie possessed the most divergent VHSV-IVb sequence. The in vitro immunogenicity analysis of that sample displayed reduced virulence (as did the other samples from 2016), in comparison to the original VHSV-IVb isolate (which had been traced back to 2003, as an origin date). The 2016 isolates that we tested induced milder impacts on fish host cell innate antiviral responses, suggesting altered phenotypic effects. In conclusion, our overall findings indicate that VHSV-IVb has undergone continued sequence change and a trend to lower virulence over its evolutionary history (2003 through present-day), which may facilitate its long-term persistence in fish host populations.","[Niner, Megan D.] Univ Toledo, Dept Environm Sci, Toledo, OH USA; [Stepien, Carol A.] Washington Univ, Sch Oceanog, St Louis, MO USA; [Stepien, Carol A.] NOAA Pacific Marine Environm Lab, Genet & Genom Grp, Seattle, WA 98115 USA; [Gorgoglione, Bartolomeo; Leaman, Douglas W.] Univ Toledo, Dept Biol Sci, Toledo, OH USA; [Leaman, Douglas W.] Wright State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Dayton, OH 45435 USA; [Gorgoglione, Bartolomeo] CVM, Dept Pathobiol & Diagnost Invest, Aquat Anim Hlth Lab, E Lansing, MI USA; [Leaman, Douglas W.] Michigan State Univ, CANR, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Leaman, Douglas W.] Auburn Univ, Montgomery, AL USA","University System of Ohio; University of Toledo; Washington University (WUSTL); National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University System of Ohio; University of Toledo; University System of Ohio; Wright State University Dayton; Michigan State University; Auburn University System; Auburn University Montgomery; Auburn University","Stepien, CA (corresponding author), Washington Univ, Sch Oceanog, St Louis, MO USA.;Stepien, CA (corresponding author), NOAA Pacific Marine Environm Lab, Genet & Genom Grp, Seattle, WA 98115 USA.","cstepien@uw.edu","Gorgoglione, Bartolomeo/AAG-8492-2019; Stepien, Carol/GWU-8631-2022","Stepien, Carol/0000-0002-5544-4333; Gorgoglione, Bartolomeo/0000-0001-9458-6249","USDA-ARS CRIS [58-3655-9-748, 3655-31320-002-00D]; [NSF-DBI-1354806]","USDA-ARS CRIS(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)USDA Agricultural Research Service);","Research funding was provided by grants to CAS and DWL, including NSF-DBI-1354806 for Gene diversity of the VHS fish virus: Evolution of cellular immune response and pathogenesis and USDA-ARS CRIS #3655-31320-002-00D, under specific cooperative agreement #58-3655-9-748, VHS fish virus in yellow perch aquaculture.",NA,126,2,2,0,5,"PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE","SAN FRANCISCO","1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA","1932-6203","","","PLOS ONE","PLoS One","MAY 28",2021,16,"5",NA,"","","",NA,NA,"e0232923","10.1371/journal.pone.0232923","http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0232923",NA,"",30,"Multidisciplinary Sciences","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Science & Technology - Other Topics","SW6PN",34048438,"Green Published, gold","","","2024-10-25","WOS:000664636100001","View Full Record in Web of Science",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

While the ANG is found in multiple cephalopod families, little is known about the global microbial diversity of these ANG bacterial symbionts. We used 16S rRNA gene community analysis to characterize the ANG microbiome from different cephalopod species and assess the relationship between host and symbiont phylogenies. The ANG microbiome of 11 species of cephalopods from four families (superorder: Decapodiformes) that span seven geographic locations was characterized. Bacteria of class Alphaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, and Flavobacteriia were found in all species, yet analysis of amplicon sequence variants by multiple distance metrics revealed a significant difference between ANG microbiomes of cephalopod families (weighted/unweighted UniFrac, Bray-Curtis, P = 0.001). Despite being collected from widely disparate geographic locations, members of the family Sepiolidae (bobtail squid) shared many bacterial taxa including (similar to 50%) Opitutae (Verrucomicrobia) and Ruegeria (Alphaproteobacteria) species. Furthermore, we tested for phylosymbiosis and found a positive correlation between host phylogenetic distance and bacterial community dissimilarity (Mantel test r = 0.7). These data suggest that closely related sepiolids select for distinct symbionts from similar bacterial taxa. Overall, the ANGs of different cephalopod species harbor distinct microbiomes and thus offer a diverse symbiont community to explore antimicrobial activity and other functional roles in host fitness. IMPORTANCE Many aquatic organisms recruit microbial symbionts from the environment that provide a variety of functions, including defense from pathogens. Some female cephalopods (squids, bobtail squids, and cuttlefish) have a reproductive organ called the accessory nidamental gland (ANG) that contains a bacterial consortium that protects eggs from pathogens. Despite the wide distribution of these cephalopods, whether they share similar microbiomes is unknown. Here, we studied the microbial diversity of the ANG in 11 species of cephalopods distributed over a broad geographic range and representing 15-120 million years of host divergence. The ANG microbiomes shared some bacterial taxa, but each cephalopod species had unique symbiotic members. Additionally, analysis of host-symbiont phylogenies suggests that the evolutionary histories of the partners have been important in shaping the ANG microbiome. This study advances our knowledge of cephalopod-bacteria relationships and provides a foundation to explore defensive symbionts in other systems.","[Vijayan, Nidhi; McAnulty, Sarah J.; Kerwin, Allison H.; Nyholm, Spencer V.] Univ Connecticut, Dept Mol & Cell Biol, Storrs, CT 06269 USA; [Sanchez, Gustavo; Jolly, Jeffrey] Okinawa Inst Sci & Technol, Mol Genet Unit, Onna, Okinawa, Japan; [Sanchez, Gustavo] Hiroshima Univ, Grad Sch Integrated Sci Life, Hiroshima, Japan; [Jolly, Jeffrey] Okinawa Inst Sci & Technol, Marine Climate Change Unit, Onna, Okinawa, Japan; [Ikeda, Yuzuru] Univ Ryukyus, Fac Sci, Dept Chem Biol & Marine Sci, Onna, Okinawa, Japan; [Nishiguchi, Michele K.] Univ Calif Merced, Dept Mol & Cell Biol, Merced, CA USA; [Reveillac, Elodie] La Rochelle Univ, Littoral Environm & Soc LIENSs, CNRS, UMR 7266, La Rochelle, France; [Gestal, Camino] CSIC, Inst Marine Res IIM, Vigo, Spain; [Spady, Blake L.] James Cook Univ, Coll Sci & Engn, Townsville, Qld, Australia; [Spady, Blake L.] US Natl Ocean & Atmospher Adm, Natl Environm Satellite Data & Informat Serv, Ctr Satellite Applicat & Res, Coral Reef Watch, College Pk, MD USA; [Li, Diana H.] Columbia Univ, Mortimer B Zuckerman Mind Brain Behav Inst, New York, NY USA; [Burford, Benjamin P.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Ocean Associates Inc, Southwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv,NOAA, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Kerwin, Allison H.] McDaniel Coll, Dept Biol, Westminster, MD 21157 USA","University of Connecticut; Okinawa Institute of Science & Technology Graduate University; Hiroshima University; Okinawa Institute of Science & Technology Graduate University; University of California System; University of California Merced; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Ecology & Environment (INEE); Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Instituto de Investigaciones Marinas (IIM); James Cook University; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Columbia University; University of California System; University of California Santa Cruz; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA","Kerwin, AH; Nyholm, SV (corresponding author), Univ Connecticut, Dept Mol & Cell Biol, Storrs, CT 06269 USA.;Kerwin, AH (corresponding author), McDaniel Coll, Dept Biol, Westminster, MD 21157 USA.","akerwin@mcdaniel.edu; spencer.nyholm@uconn.edu","Li, Diana/KRP-6271-2024; Gestal, Camino/F-5062-2016","Vijayan, Nidhi/0000-0002-0615-9587; Gestal, Camino/0000-0003-1931-9567; Nishiguchi, Michele/0000-0002-8950-4621","Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation (GBMF); Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University; University of California Berkeley","Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation (GBMF)(Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation); Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University(Okinawa Institute of Science & Technology Graduate University); University of California Berkeley(University of California System)","We thank D.

To improve quantitative guidelines for taxonomic decisions in cetaceans, we build on a previous effort targeting the control region and evaluate, for whole mitogenome sequences, a suite of divergence and diagnosability estimates for pairs of recognized cetacean populations, subspecies, and species. From this overview, we recommend new guidelines based on complete mitogenomes, combined with other types of evidence for isolation and divergence, which will improve resolution for taxonomic decisions, especially in the face of small sample sizes or low levels of genetic diversity.

Reduced life history diversity within these populations inhibits their ability to respond to these stressors. Putah Creek, a small creek in California's Central Valley that once supported Chinook Salmon, is undergoing restoration to provide spawning habitats for this imperiled species. Beginning in 2014, increasing numbers of Chinook Salmon spawned throughout the creek, and emigrating juveniles were observed in the following months. Here we used otolith annual growth bands and microchemistry to investigate the age structure and natal origins of the adult spawners. Most individuals were 2 or 3 years old, and they originated from at least seven different natal sources, overwhelmingly from Central Valley hatcheries (similar to 88%). These findings highlight that straying fall-run Central Valley Chinook Salmon can rapidly utilize restored habitats, potentially establishing new populations. However, to facilitate local adaptations, straying rates and gene flow will have to be managed over time. Reconnecting migratory pathways and restoring many small and diverse streams, like Putah Creek, provides an opportunity to increase life history diversity, strengthening the recovery and resilience of Chinook Salmon.","[Willmes, Malte; Jacinto, Emily E.; Lewis, Levi S.; Fichman, Rachel A.; Bess, Zachary; Singer, Gabriel; Steel, Anna; Moyle, Peter; Rypel, Andrew L.; Fangue, Nann; Hobbs, James A.; Chapman, Eric D.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Wildlife Fish & Conservat Biol, 1 Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Willmes, Malte] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Inst Marine Sci, NOAA, Fisheries Collaborat Program, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Moyle, Peter; Rypel, Andrew L.] Univ Calif Davis, Ctr Watershed Sci, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Glessner, Justin J.

U.S. North Pacific groundfish fisheries catch thousands of Northern Fulmars (Fulmarus glacialis rodgersii) each year, making fulmars the most frequently caught seabird in federally managed U.S. fisheries. Here, we used genetic stock identification to assign 1,536 fulmars sampled as bycatch to one of four Alaska breeding colonies and quantified the similarity of bycatch locations at sea among colonies. We found disproportionately high bycatch from the Pribilof Islands (6% of metapopulation, 23% of bycatch), and disproportionately low bycatch from Chagulak Island (34% of metapopulation, 14% of bycatch). Overlap between fisheries and colony-specific foraging areas diverge more during the summer breeding season, leading to greater differences in bycatch susceptibility. Contemporary and historical gene flow likely contributes to low genetic differentiation among colonies (F-ST = 0.003-0.01), yet these values may not represent present connectivity. Our findings illustrate how genetic stock identification can link at-sea threats to colonies and inform management to reduce bycatch from impacted colonies.","[Baetscher, Diana S.; Garza, John Carlos] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Baetscher, Diana S.; Anderson, Eric C.; Garza, John Carlos] NOAA, Southwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Santa Cruz, CA USA; [Beck, Jessie; Nevins, Hannah] Oikonos Ecosyst Knowledge, Santa Cruz, CA 95063 USA; [Ruegg, Kristen] Colorado State Univ, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Ramey, Andrew M.] US Geol Survey, Alaska Sci Ctr, Anchorage, AK USA; [Hatch, Scott] Inst Seabird Res & Conservat, Anchorage, AK USA; [Fitzgerald, Shannon M.] NOAA, Alaska Fisheries Sci Ctr, Seattle, WA USA; [Baetscher, Diana S.] NOAA, Alaska Fisheries Sci Ctr, Auke Bay Labs, Juneau, AK USA","University of California System; University of California Santa Cruz; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Colorado State University; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA","Beck, J (corresponding author), Oikonos Ecosyst Knowledge, Santa Cruz, CA 95063 USA.;Baetscher, DS (corresponding author), NOAA, Alaska Fisheries Sci Ctr, Juneau, AK 99801 USA.","diana.baetscher@noaa.gov; jessie@oikonos.org","Beck, Jessie/HKN-9242-2023","Baetscher, Diana/0000-0001-5152-2560; Anderson, Eric/0000-0003-1326-0840; Ruegg, Kristen/0000-0001-5579-941X","North Pacific Research Board [1714]","North Pacific Research Board","North Pacific Research Board, Grant/Award Number: Project 1714",NA,72,6,6,3,14,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","1752-4571","","","EVOL APPL","Evol.

However, most marine fishes cannot synthesise the physiologically indispensable fatty acid, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), due to incomplete DHA biosynthetic pathways, which must be adapted to survive in freshwater environments where DHA is poor relative to marine environments. By analysing DHA biosynthetic pathways of one marine and three freshwater-dependent species from the flatfish family Achiridae, we revealed that functions of fatty acid metabolising enzymes have uniquely and independently evolved by multi-functionalisation or neofunctionalisation in each freshwater species, such that every functional combination of the enzymes has converged to generate complete and functional DHA biosynthetic pathways. Our results demonstrate the elaborate patchwork of fatty acid metabolism and the importance of acquiring DHA biosynthetic function in order for fish to cross the nutritional barrier at the mouth of rivers and colonise freshwater environments. Matsushita et al. demonstrate the evolution of DHA biosynthetic mechanisms in four species of flatfish as some of them colonised freshwater environments. Their analyses show independent changes to the biosynthetic pathways as a way to overcome the lack of exogenous DHA that would typically be available from prey in the marine environment.","[Matsushita, Yoshiyuki; Miyoshi, Kaho; Kabeya, Naoki; Sanada, Shuwa; Yazawa, Ryosuke; Haga, Yutaka; Satoh, Shuichi; Yamamoto, Yoji; Struessmann, Carlos Augusto; Yoshizaki, Goro] Tokyo Univ Marine Sci & Technol, Dept Marine Biosci, Minato Ku, 4-5-7 Konan, Tokyo 1088477, Japan; [Luckenbach, John Adam] Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Environm & Fisheries Sci Div, Northwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, NOAA, 2725 Montlake Blvd East, Seattle, WA 98112 USA","Tokyo University of Marine Science & Technology; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA","Yoshizaki, G (corresponding author), Tokyo Univ Marine Sci & Technol, Dept Marine Biosci, Minato Ku, 4-5-7 Konan, Tokyo 1088477, Japan.","goro@kaiyodai.ac.jp","HAGA, Yutaka/O-1950-2014; Strussmann, Carlos/O-1932-2014; Kabeya, Naoki/A-2113-2015","Haga, Yutaka/0000-0002-3528-0554; Kabeya, Naoki/0000-0002-2055-6554; Matsushita, Yoshiyuki/0000-0001-7829-6508","JSPS KAKENHI [JP19J14936, 19K22329]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [19K22329] Funding Source: KAKEN","JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","This work was partly supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Numbers JP19J14936 and 19K22329.",NA,60,20,20,0,13,"NATURE PORTFOLIO","BERLIN","HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY","","2399-3642","","COMMUN BIOL","Commun.

ET0 was estimated using the FAO-56 Penman-Monteith (FAO56PM) equation and observed meteorological data. The estimated ET0 using FAO56PM was then used as the target output for the machine learning models, while the observed meteorological data were used as the model inputs. Based on the coefficient of determination (R-2), root mean square error (RMSE), and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (EF), the RBFNN and GEP models showed promising performance.

White muscle was analyzed for stable isotopes (delta 13C and delta 15N) to evaluate potential niche overlap in these four sympatric mesopredators. Significant differences were found in both delta 13C and delta 15N signatures across species, suggesting a degree of resource partitioning. When examined within tissue type, the host species had a weak effect on beta-diversity for cloaca and skin, with no differences found for gill and gut samples. However, network analysis metrics demonstrated a stronger species-specific effect and distinct microbial community relationships were apparent between the shark and batoids, with the former having tighter networks for both internally- and externally-influenced tissues (gut/cloaca and skin/gills, respectively).

Our objective was to determine if coral colonies showing signs of SCTLD possess a specific microbial signature across five susceptible species sampled in Florida's Coral Reef. Three sample types were collected: lesion tissue and apparently unaffected tissue of diseased colonies, and tissue of apparently healthy colonies. Using 16S rRNA high-throughput gene sequencing, our results show that, for every species, the microbial community composition of lesion tissue was significantly different from healthy colony tissue and from the unaffected tissue of diseased colonies. The lesion tissue of all but one species (Siderastrea siderea) had higher relative abundances of the order Rhodobacterales compared with other types of tissue samples, which may partly explain why S. siderea lesions often differed in appearance compared to other species. The order Clostridiales was also present at relatively high abundances in the lesion tissue of three species compared to healthy and unaffected tissues. Stress often leads to the dysbiosis of coral microbiomes and increases the abundance of opportunistic pathogens. The present study suggests that Rhodobacterales and Clostridiales likely play an important role in SCTLD.","[Clark, Abigail S.; Muller, Erinn M.] Elizabeth Moore Int Ctr Coral Reef Res & Restorat, Mote Marine Lab, Summerland Key, FL 33042 USA; [Williams, Sara D.; Muller, Erinn M.] Mote Marine Lab, Sarasota, FL 34236 USA; [Maxwell, Kerry; Hunt, John H.] Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservat Commiss, South Florida Reg Lab, Fish & Wildlife Res Inst, Marathon, FL 33050 USA; [Rosales, Stephanie M.] Univ Miami, Cooperat Inst Marine & Atmospher Studies, Miami, FL 33149 USA; [Rosales, Stephanie M.] NOAA, Atlantic Oceanog & Meteorol Lab, Miami, FL 33149 USA; [Huebner, Lindsay K.; Landsberg, Jan H.] Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservat Commiss, Fish & Wildlife Res Inst, St Petersburg, FL 33701 USA","Mote Marine Laboratory & Aquarium; Mote Marine Laboratory & Aquarium; Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservation Commission; University of Miami; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Atlantic Oceanographic & Meteorological Laboratory (AOML); Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservation Commission","Clark, AS (corresponding author), Elizabeth Moore Int Ctr Coral Reef Res & Restorat, Mote Marine Lab, Summerland Key, FL 33042 USA.","aclark@mote.org; swilliams@mote.org; Kerry.Maxwell@myfwc.com; Stephanie.Rosales@noaa.gov; Lindsay.Huebner@myfwc.com; Jan.Landsberg@myfwc.com; John.Hunt@myfwc.com; emuller@mote.org","Rosales, Stephanie/Z-4923-2019; Huebner, Lindsay/AAI-9558-2020","Clark, Abigail/0000-0002-0191-0933; Muller, Erinn/0000-0002-2695-2064; Williams, Sara/0000-0002-6667-6332; Huebner, Lindsay/0000-0003-0413-9408","U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Funds [FL-T-F18AF00492]; Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC); FWC [18099]; FWC from the Florida Coastal Office, Florida Department of Environmental Protection Coral Reef Conservation Program [B25636]","U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Funds; Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC); FWC; FWC from the Florida Coastal Office, Florida Department of Environmental Protection Coral Reef Conservation Program","This research was supported by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Funds for State Wildlife Grant Award FL-T-F18AF00492, awarded to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC), with a subcontract to the Mote Marine Laboratory (FWC grant agreement number 18099) for laboratory assays, sequencing, and data analysis.

While it is well known that such behaviors are heritable the genes and molecular pathways connected to these behaviors remain unknown. We used an RNA-seq approach to identify genes and molecular pathways differentially regulated in brain tissue between shy and bold brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis). A small number of genes were differentially expressed between the behavioral types at several months after hatching and two years of age. Pathway analysis revealed that EIF2 signaling differed consistently between shy and bold individuals suggesting large-scale differences in protein synthesis between behavioral types in the brain. Additionally, the RNA-seq data were used to find polymorphisms within the brook trout genome and a GWAS approach was used to test for statistical associations between genetic variants and behavior type. One allele located in a transcription factor (TSHZ3) contained a protein-coding non-synonymous SNP suggesting that functional variation within TSHZ3 is connected to the development of different behaviors. These results suggest that the molecular basis of behavioral development is complex and due to the differential expression of many genes involved in a wide-range of different molecular pathways.","[Hale, Matthew C.] Texas Christian Univ, Dept Biol, Ft Worth, TX 76129 USA; [McLaughlin, Robert] Univ Guelph, Dept Integrat Biol, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada; [Wilson, Chris] Trent Univ, Ontario Minist Nat Resources, Aquat Biodivers & Conservat Unit, Peterborough, ON K9J 7B8, Canada; [Mackereth, Robert] Lakehead Univ, Dept Biol, Thunder Bay, ON P7B 5E1, Canada; [Nichols, Krista M.] NOAA, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Northwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Conservat Biol Div, Seattle, WA 98112 USA","Texas Christian University; University of Guelph; Trent University; Ministry of Natural Resources & Forestry; Lakehead University; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA","Hale, MC (corresponding author), Texas Christian Univ, Dept Biol, Ft Worth, TX 76129 USA.","m.c.hale@tcu.edu","","Mackereth, Robert/0000-0002-5017-1567","Great Lakes Fishery Commission","Great Lakes Fishery Commission","The authors would like to thank Garrett McKinney, Mac Campbell, Ashley Elias, and two anonymous reviewers for providing valuable feedback and comments on earlier versions of this manuscript.

We examined the microbiota associated with 75 epidermal samples opportunistically collected from nine species within four marine mammal families, including: Balaenopteridae (sei and fin whales), Phocidae (harbour seal), Physeteridae (sperm whales) and Delphinidae (bottlenose dolphins, pantropical spotted dolphins, rough-toothed dolphins, short-finned pilot whales and melon-headed whales). The skin was sampled from free-ranging animals in Hawai'i (Pacific Ocean) and off the east coast of the United States (Atlantic Ocean), and the composition of the bacterial community was examined using the sequencing of partial small subunit (SSU) ribosomal RNA genes. Skin microbiotas were significantly different among host species and taxonomic families, and microbial community distance was positively correlated with mitochondrial-based host genetic divergence. The oceanic location could play a role in skin microbiota variation, but skin from species sampled in both locations is necessary to determine this influence. These data suggest that a phylosymbiotic relationship may exist between microbiota and their marine mammal hosts, potentially providing specific health and immune-related functions that contribute to the success of these animals in diverse ocean ecosystems.","[Apprill, Amy; Miller, Carolyn A.; Weber, Laura] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Marine Chem & Geochem Dept, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; [Van Cise, Amy M.; Bogomolni, Andrea] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Biol, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; [U'Ren, Jana M.] Univ Arizona, BIOS Inst, Tucson, AZ USA; [U'Ren, Jana M.] Univ Arizona, Dept Biosyst Engn, Tucson, AZ USA; [Leslie, Matthew S.] Swarthmore Coll, Dept Biol, Swarthmore, PA 19081 USA; [Baird, Robin W.] Cascadia Res Collect, Olympia, WA USA; [Robbins, Jooke; Landry, Scott] Ctr Coastal Studies, Provincetown, MA USA; [Waring, Gordon] NOAA, Northeast Fisheries Sci Ctr, Protected Species Branch, Woods Hole, MA USA","Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution; Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution; University of Arizona; University of Arizona; Swarthmore College; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA","Apprill, A (corresponding author), Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Marine Chem & Geochem Dept, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.","aapprill@whoi.edu","Baird, Robin/Y-8230-2019; U'Ren, Jana/Y-2113-2019","Robbins, Jooke/0000-0002-6382-722X; Baird, Robin/0000-0002-9419-6336; Leslie, Matthew/0000-0002-2536-6020; Gray, Laura/0000-0003-4957-2758","Earth Microbiome Project; WHOI Marine Mammal Center; WHOI Ocean Life Institute; WHOI's Andrew W.

Here we review the current epidemiological, clinical and experimental evidence linking pollution with cardiovascular dysfunction. Our focus is on particulate matter (PM) and the associated low molecular weight polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) as key mediators of cardiotoxicity. We begin by reviewing the growing epidemiological evidence linking air pollution to cardiovascular dysfunction in humans. We next address the pollution-based cardiotoxic mechanisms first identified in fish following the release of large quantities of PAHs into the marine environment from point oil spills (e.g. Deepwater Horizon). We finish by discussing the current state of mechanistic knowledge linking PM and PAH exposure to mammalian cardiovascular patho-physiologies such as atherosclerosis, cardiac hypertrophy, arrhythmias, contractile dysfunction and the underlying alterations in gene regulation. Our aim is to show conservation of toxicant pathways and cellular targets across vertebrate hearts to allow a broad framework of the global problem of cardiotoxic pollution to be established.

In the western North Atlantic (wNA), two ecotypes (coastal and offshore) of common bottlenose dolphin, Tursiops truncatus, exhibit some external morphological differences, and previous genetic findings suggested that they could be different species. However, their taxonomy remains unsettled. Using an integrative approach comparing traditional and geometric morphometrics, mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, we evaluated evolutionary relationships between these ecotypes. We observed congruence among these lines of evidence, strongly indicating that the wNA ecotypes are following distinct evolutionary trajectories. Based on mitochondrial DNA analyses, we detected significant divergence (Nei's d(A) = 0.027), unshared haplotypes and one fixed difference leading to complete diagnosability (percentage diagnosable = 100%) of the wNA coastal ecotype. We found morphological diagnosability and negligible nuclear gene flow between the wNA ecotypes. Integration of these multiple lines of evidence revealed that the wNA coastal ecotype is an independent evolutionary unit, appearing to be more closely related to coastal dolphins in the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea than to their parapatric offshore neighbours, while the offshore dolphins form a relatively cohesive worldwide unit, T. truncatus. We propose that this coastal ecotype is recognized as a distinct species, resurrecting the name Tursiops erebennus.","[Costa, Ana P.

The relative importance of photic zone processes versus local biogeochemical conditions in mesopelagic microbial dynamics, especially seasonal dynamics, is largely unknown. We employed rRNA gene transcript-based high-throughput sequencing on 189 samples collected from both the photic and mesopelagic zones, along with seasonal observations, to understand the South China Sea's protistan-bacterial microbiota diversity, drivers, and mechanisms. Mesopelagic communities displayed unexpectedly greater seasonal but less vertical dynamics than photic counterparts. Temperature, dissolved oxygen, nutrients, and bacterial abundance drove mesopelagic communities vertically. Photic zone processes (using net community production and mixed layer depth as proxies) of past seasons, coinciding with strong monsoon periods, shaped seasonal fluctuations in mesopelagic communities, indicating a time-lag effect. Furthermore, certain microbes were identified as indicators for beta diversity by depth and season. This investigation deepens our understanding of how and why mesopelagic communities vary with season and depth. Recognizing the timelagged effect of photic zone processes on mesopelagic communities is crucial for understanding the current and future configurations of the ocean microbiome, especially in the context of climate change and its effect on carbon export and ocean storage.","[Sun, Ping; Wang, Ying; Huang, Xin; Xu, Susu] Xiamen Univ, Coll Environm & Ecol, Key Lab, Minist Educ Coastal & Wetland Ecosyst, Xiamen 361102, Peoples R China; [Sun, Ping; Huang, Bangqin] Xiamen Univ, Fujian Prov Key Lab Coastal Ecol & Environm Studie, Xiamen 361102, Peoples R China; [Logares, Ramiro] CSIC, Inst Marine Sci ICM, Barcelona 08003, Catalonia, Spain; [Huang, Yibin] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Ocean Sci, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Huang, Yibin] NOAA, Pacific Marine Environm Lab, Seattle, WA 98115 USA; [Huang, Yibin; Xu, Dapeng; Huang, Bangqin] Xiamen Univ, Coll Ocean & Earth Sci, State Key Lab Marine Environm Sci, Xiamen, Peoples R China; [Xu, Dapeng] Xiamen Univ, Inst Marine Microbes & Ecospheres, Coll Ocean & Earth Sci, Xiamen 361102, Peoples R China","Xiamen University; Xiamen University; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Centro Mediterraneo de Investigaciones Marinas y Ambientales (CMIMA); CSIC - Instituto de Ciencias del Mar (ICM); University of California System; University of California Santa Cruz; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Xiamen University; Xiamen University","Sun, P (corresponding author), Xiamen Univ, Coll Environm & Ecol, Key Lab, Minist Educ Coastal & Wetland Ecosyst, Xiamen 361102, Peoples R China.;Sun, P; Huang, BQ (corresponding author), Xiamen Univ, Fujian Prov Key Lab Coastal Ecol & Environm Studie, Xiamen 361102, Peoples R China.","psun@xmu.edu.cn; bqhuang@xmu.edu.cn","Logares, Ramiro/AAI-2306-2019; Xu, Susu/AAY-4960-2021; Logares, Ramiro/D-5920-2011","Logares, Ramiro/0000-0002-8213-0604","Natural Science Foundation of China; Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province [42130401, 42141002, 41876142, 2022J01055, 41849906, 41949906]","Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province(Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province)","We sincerely thank Dr. Phyllis Lam whose suggestions greatly improved the manuscript.

The two subspecies in the family Platanistidae, Indus, and Ganges river dolphins (P. g. minor and P. g. gangetica), are both threatened by dams and barrages, declining river flows, fisheries bycatch, and pollution. We examine differences in external and skull morphology between dolphins in each river system to clarify their taxonomic status. Skulls from each river system could easily be differentiated using diagnostic differences in the shape of the frontal bones behind the nasals. This feature was present in all individuals irrespective of size, age, and sex. Ganges river dolphins are sexually dimorphic with females larger than males, but there was no evidence of dimorphism in the small sample of Indus river dolphins. There were no mitochondrial DNA haplotypes shared between the two river systems, and five fixed differences suggested a long-term (approximately 0.55 million years) absence of gene flow. Diagnosable differences in morphological and genetic characteristics indicate long-term reproductive as well as geographic isolation of Indus and Ganges river dolphins. We conclude that Indus and Ganges river dolphins should each be recognized as distinct species, and elevate the Indus subspecies, Platanista gangetica minor, to species level, Platanista minor Owen, 1853.

Control purposes include the use of cultured animals to develop population control methods (e.g., gene drives), the production of hard-to-find life stages for research (e.g., age-0 larvae, metamorphosed juveniles), or the recovery of native lampreys impacted by sea lamprey control practices. For restoration, Pacific lamprey (Entosphenus tridentatus) and European river lamprey (Lampetra fluviatilis) are cultured both for research (e.g., animals to conduct passage studies) and outplanting to supplement natural production. Research and development of techniques for rearing anadromous lampreys have revealed vulnerabilities and resiliencies that could also inform control programs. We review this information, provide case studies of lamprey production (both planned and unplanned), and prescribe a blueprint for the facilities and support needed to produce 1000 metamorphosed anadromous juveniles from artificial production.

Many of these interventions target naturally heat-tolerant individuals to boost climate resilience, but the challenges of quickly and reliably quantifying heat tolerance and identifying thermotolerant individuals have hampered implementation. Here, we used coral bleaching automated stress systems to perform rapid, standardized heat tolerance assays on 229 colonies of Acropora cervicornis across six coral nurseries spanning Florida's Coral Reef, USA. Analysis of heat stress dose-response curves for each colony revealed a broad range in thermal tolerance among individuals (approx. 2.5 degrees C range in F-v/F-m ED50), with highly reproducible rankings across independent tests (r = 0.76). Most phenotypic variation occurred within nurseries rather than between them, pointing to a potentially dominant role of fixed genetic effects in setting thermal tolerance and widespread distribution of tolerant individuals throughout the population. The identification of tolerant individuals provides immediately actionable information to optimize nursery and restoration programmes for Florida's threatened staghorn corals. This work further provides a blueprint for future efforts to identify and source thermally tolerant corals for conservation interventions worldwide.","[Cunning, Ross; Parker, Katherine E.] John G Shedd Aquarium, Daniel P Haerther Ctr Conservat & Res, Chicago, IL 60605 USA; [Johnson-Sapp, Kelsey; Karp, Richard F.; Wen, Alexandra D.; Williamson, Olivia M.; D'Alessandro, Martine; Lirman, Diego; Baker, Andrew C.] Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Dept Marine Biol & Ecol, 4600 Rickenbacker Causeway, Miami, FL 33149 USA; [van Hooidonk, Ruben] Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Cooperat Inst Marine & Atmospher Studies, 4600 Rickenbacker Causeway, Miami, FL 33149 USA; [Bartels, Erich] Mote Marine Lab, Elizabeth Moore Int Ctr Coral Reef Res & Restorat, Summerland Key, FL USA; [Gilliam, David S.; Hanson, Grace] Nova Southeastern Univ, Halmos Coll Arts & Sci, Dania, FL USA; [Levy, Jessica; Moura, Amelia] Coral Restorat Fdn, Key Largo, FL USA; [Maxwell, Kerry; Reckenbeil, Brian] Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservat, Marathon, FL USA; [Million, Wyatt C.; Kenkel, Carly] Univ Southern Calif, Dept Biol Sci, Los Angeles, CA 90007 USA; [Moulding, Alison L.] NOAA, Protected Resources Div, Fisheries Southeast Reg Off, St Petersburg, FL USA; [Muller, Erinn M.] Mote Marine Lab, Coral Hlth & Dis Program, Sarasota, FL 34236 USA; [Nedimyer, Ken] Reef Renewal USA, Tavernier, FL USA; [van Hooidonk, Ruben] NOAA, Ocean Chem & Ecosyst Div, Atlantic Oceanog & Meteorol Lab, Miami, FL USA; [Dahlgren, Craig] Perry Inst Marine Sci, Waitsfield, VT USA; [Parkinson, John E.] Univ S Florida, Dept Integrat Biol, Tampa, FL 33620 USA","University of Miami; University of Miami; Mote Marine Laboratory & Aquarium; Nova Southeastern University; Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservation Commission; University of Southern California; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Mote Marine Laboratory & Aquarium; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Atlantic Oceanographic & Meteorological Laboratory (AOML); State University System of Florida; University of South Florida","Cunning, R (corresponding author), John G Shedd Aquarium, Daniel P Haerther Ctr Conservat & Res, Chicago, IL 60605 USA.","ross.cunning@gmail.com","Parkinson, John/P-4831-2019; Kenkel, Carly/AGH-5526-2022; Karp, Richard/LMO-7507-2024; van Hooidonk, Ruben/F-7395-2010; Parkinson, John/K-1873-2014","D'Alessandro, Martine/0000-0003-4148-7217; Gilliam, David/0000-0002-8730-2399; Parkinson, John/0000-0001-8386-3044; Baker, Andrew/0000-0002-7866-2587; Johnson-Sapp, Kelsey/0000-0001-5640-9698; Parker, Katherine/0000-0002-1593-7803; Cunning, Ross/0000-0001-7241-1181; Williamson, Olivia/0000-0002-1710-1671","NSF [OCE-2023705]; Paul M.

Toothed whales acquired specialized high-frequency hearing tied to the evolution of echolocation, whereas baleen whales evolved low-frequency hearing. More generally, all cetaceans show adaptations for hearing and seeing underwater. To determine the extent to which these phenotypic changes have been driven by molecular adaptation, we performed large-scale targeted sequence capture of 179 sensory genes across the Cetacea, incorporating up to 54 cetacean species from all major clades as well as their closest relatives, the hippopotamuses. We screened for positive selection in 167 loci related to vision and hearing and found that the diversification of cetaceans has been accompanied by pervasive molecular adaptations in both sets of genes, including several loci implicated in nonsyndromic hearing loss. Despite these findings, however, we found no direct evidence of positive selection at the base of odontocetes coinciding with the origin of echolocation, as found in studies examining fewer taxa. By using contingency tables incorporating taxon- and gene-based controls, we show that, although numbers of positively selected hearing and nonsyndromic hearing loss genes are disproportionately high in cetaceans, counts of vision genes do not differ significantly from expected values. Alongside these adaptive changes, we find increased evidence of pseudogenization of genes involved in cone-mediated vision in mysticetes and deep-diving odontocetes.","[McGowen, Michael R.; Tsagkogeorga, Georgia; Williamson, Joseph; Rossiter, Stephen J.] Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Biol & Chem Sci, London, England; [McGowen, Michael R.] Smithsonian Natl Museum Nat Hist, Dept Vertebrate Zool, Washington, DC 20560 USA; [Morin, Phillip A.] NOAA, Southwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, La Jolla, CA USA","University of London; Queen Mary University London; Smithsonian Institution; Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA","McGowen, MR; Rossiter, SJ (corresponding author), Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Biol & Chem Sci, London, England.;McGowen, MR (corresponding author), Smithsonian Natl Museum Nat Hist, Dept Vertebrate Zool, Washington, DC 20560 USA.","mcgowenm@si.edu; s.j.rossiter@qmul.ac.uk","Williamson, Joseph/S-2511-2019; Rossiter, Stephen/E-2111-2011; Morin, Phillip/E-9515-2010","Williamson, Joseph/0000-0003-4916-5386","Royal Society Newton International Fellowship; European Research Council Starting Grant [310482]; European Research Council (ERC) [310482] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC)","Royal Society Newton International Fellowship(Royal Society); European Research Council Starting Grant(European Research Council (ERC)); European Research Council (ERC)","We would like to thank Ryan Schott, Jason de Koning, and two anonymous reviewers for providing comments on earlier versions of this study.

On coral reefs, mass coral bleaching and mortality have emerged as ubiquitous responses to ocean warming, yet one of the greatest challenges of this epiphenomenon is linking information across scientific disciplines and spatial and temporal scales. Here we review some of the seminal and recent coral-bleaching discoveries from an ecological, physiological, and molecular perspective. We also evaluate which data and processes can improve predictive models and provide a conceptual framework that integrates measurements across biological scales. Taking an integrative approach across biological and spatial scales, using for example hierarchical models to estimate major coral-reef processes, will not only rapidly advance coral-reef science but will also provide necessary information to guide decision-making and conservation efforts. To conserve reefs, we encourage implementing mesoscale sanctuaries (thousands of km(2)) that transcend national boundaries. Such networks of protected reefs will provide reef connectivity, through larval dispersal that transverse thermal environments, and genotypic repositories that may become essential units of selection for environmentally diverse locations. Together, multinational networks may be the best chance corals have to persist through climate change, while humanity struggles to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases to net zero.","[van Woesik, Robert; Shlesinger, Tom] Florida Inst Technol, Inst Global Ecol, Melbourne, FL 32901 USA; [Grottoli, Andrea G.; Hulver, Ann Marie; Chapron, Leila; McLachlan, Rowan H.] Ohio State Univ, Sch Earth Sci, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Toonen, Rob J.; Madin, Joshua S.; McManus, Lisa C.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Hawaii Inst Marine Biol, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Thurber, Rebecca Vega; McLachlan, Rowan H.] Oregon State Univ, Dept Microbiol, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Warner, Mark E.] Univ Delaware, Sch Marine Sci & Policy, Lewes, DE 19958 USA; [Albright, Rebecca] Calif Acad Sci, San Francisco, CA 94118 USA; [Crandall, Eric] Penn State Univ, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [DeCarlo, Thomas M.] Hawaii Pacific Univ, Honolulu, HI USA; [Donovan, Mary K.] Arizona State Univ, Ctr Global Discovery & Conservat Sci, Tempe, AZ USA; [Donovan, Mary K.] Arizona State Univ, Sch Geog Sci & Urban Planning, Tempe, AZ USA; [Eirin-Lopez, Jose; Rodriguez-Lanetty, Mauricio] Florida Int Univ, Inst Environm, Miami, FL 33199 USA; [Harrison, Hugo B.; Heron, Scott F.] James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld, Australia; [Harrison, Hugo B.] Australian Inst Marine Sci, Townsville, Qld, Australia; [Heron, Scott F.] James Cook Univ, Phys & Marine Geophys Lab, Townsville, Qld, Australia; [Huang, Danwei] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Biol Sci, Singapore, Singapore; [Humanes, Adriana] Newcastle Univ, Sch Nat & Environm Sci, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England; [Krueger, Thomas] Univ Cambridge, Dept Biochem, Cambridge, England; [Manzello, Derek] NOAA, Ctr Satellite Applicat & Res, Satellite Oceanog & Climate Div, College Pk, MD USA; [Matz, Mikhail] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Integrat Biol, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Muller, Erinn M.] Mote Marine Lab, Sarasota, FL 34236 USA; [Vega-Rodriguez, Maria] Puerto Rico Dept Nat & Environm Resources, San Juan, PR USA; [Voolstra, Christian R.] Univ Konstanz, Dept Biol, Constance, Germany; [Zaneveld, Jesse] Univ Washington, Div Biol Sci, Bothell, WA USA","Florida Institute of Technology; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; Oregon State University; University of Delaware; California Academy of Sciences; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; Hawaii Pacific University; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; State University System of Florida; Florida International University; James Cook University; ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies; Australian Institute of Marine Science; James Cook University; National University of Singapore; Newcastle University - UK; University of Cambridge; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; Mote Marine Laboratory & Aquarium; University of Konstanz; University of Washington; University of Washington Bothell","van Woesik, R (corresponding author), Florida Inst Technol, Inst Global Ecol, Melbourne, FL 32901 USA.","rvw@fit.edu","Harrison, Hugo/JJF-5109-2023; Zaneveld, Jesse/JZC-9450-2024; Heron, Scott/E-7928-2011; Albright, Rebecca/D-4033-2011; Toonen, Rob/V-6230-2019; Warner, Mark/J-6241-2013; Hulver, Ann/HZK-7470-2023; Manzello, Derek/A-8661-2014; Grottoli, Andrea/C-9736-2009; Krueger, Thomas/A-9029-2015; McManus, Lisa/ACU-0124-2022; DeCarlo, Thomas/AAD-8862-2019; Toonen, Robert J.

Here we investigate the function of the mRNA stem-loop 5' of the take-off codon, as well as the importance of ribosome loading density on the mRNA for efficient bypassing. We show that polysomes are less efficient at mediating bypassing than monosomes, both in vitro and in vivo, due to their preventing formation of a stem-loop 5' of the take-off codon and allowing greater peptidyl-tRNA drop off. A ribosome profiling analysis of phage T4-infected Escherichia coil yielded protected mRNA fragments within the normal size range derived from ribosomes stalled at the take-off codon. However, ribosomes at this position also yielded some 53-nucleotide fragments, 16 longer. These were due to protection of the nucleotides that form the 5' stem-loop. NMR shows that the 5' stem-loop is highly dynamic. The importance of different nucleotides in the 5' stem-loop is revealed by mutagenesis studies. These data highlight the significance of the 5' stem-loop for the 50-nt bypassing and further enhance appreciation of relevance of the extent of ribosome loading for recoding. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

Conch are slow-moving and require contact to mate; overfishing has reduced populations in many areas compromising its rates of reproduction. Long-range dispersal and mixing between distinct populations occur in the queen conch's early life history stages, when pelagic larvae are transported by oceanic currents. Genetic studies suggest that gene flow between populations decreases as the distance between populations increases. Here, we assessed how the population connectivity of conch changes with spatially variable patterns of fishing exploitation by simulating larval dispersal and comparing the potential connectivity under an unexploited and a contemporary exploited reproductive scenario. Results demonstrate that reduced egg production, due to heterogeneous fishing pressure and localized depletion, significantly alters population connectivity patterns as well as the structuring of populations and metapopulations across the species' range. This strongly suggests that estimates of contemporary demographic rates, together with estimates of reproductive output need to be included in population connectivity studies. The existence of self-sustained metapopulations of queen conch throughout the Wider Caribbean suggests that replenishment through larval dispersal occurs primarily within sub-regional spatial scales, emphasizing the need for regional and local conservation and management measures to build and protect reproductively active populations and nursery habitat across multiple jurisdictions.","[Vaz, Ana C.] Univ Miami, Cooperat Inst Marine & Atmospher Studies, Miami, FL 33146 USA; [Vaz, Ana C.; Karnauskas, Mandy; McCarthy, Kevin J.] NOAA, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Southeast Fisheries Sci Ctr, Miami, FL 33149 USA; [Vaz, Ana C.; Paris, Claire B.] Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Miami, FL 33146 USA; [Doerr, Jennifer C.] NOAA, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Southeast Fisheries Sci Ctr, Galveston, TX USA; [Hill, Ronald L.; Farmer, Nicholas A.] NOAA, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Southeast Fisheries Sci Ctr, Panama City, FL USA; [Horn, Calusa] NOAA, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Southeast Reg Off, St Petersburg, FL USA; [Miller, Margaret H.] NOAA, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Off Protected Resources, Silver Spring, MD USA; [Neuman, Melissa] NOAA, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, West Coast Reg Off, Long Beach, CA USA","University of Miami; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of Miami; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)","Vaz, AC (corresponding author), Univ Miami, Cooperat Inst Marine & Atmospher Studies, Miami, FL 33146 USA.;Vaz, AC (corresponding author), NOAA, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Southeast Fisheries Sci Ctr, Miami, FL 33149 USA.;Vaz, AC (corresponding author), Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Miami, FL 33146 USA.","avaz@rsmas.miami.edu","Vaz, Ana/AAL-3852-2021; Vaz, Ana/D-1086-2018","Vaz, Ana/0000-0003-0336-5227","","","",NA,155,7,7,2,20,"FRONTIERS MEDIA SA","LAUSANNE","AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND","","2296-7745","","FRONT MAR SCI","Front.

The latter species is of particular interest to paleontologists because it is the only living cephalopod with an internal chambered, spiral-shaped, calcareous shell resembling those seen in some fossil cephalopod taxa. Spirulida has been difficult to place phylogenetically, in part because it shares different features with sepiolids, sepiids, and oegopsids, creating conflict in morphological analyses. Unlike morphological assumptions of a close relationship with sepiids, previous molecular studies have found support for Spirulida as a close relative of Bathyteuthida and Oegopsida. Identifying the correct phylogenetic placement of Spirulida could allow alternative hypotheses of phragmocone evolution, e.g., retention of an ancestral phragmocone in Spirulida and Sepiida vs. independent reacquisition of the phragmocone in these taxa, to be evaluated. In the present study, we combined new, high-quality transcriptome data for a specimen of Spirula spirula with additional new and previously published transcriptome data for decapodiform cephalopods. Phylogenetic analyses of several matrices yielded trees in which Spirula spirula was recovered as the sister group of the oceanic open-eyed squids (Oegopsida). This close relationship of Spirula to oceanic squids, rather than to nearshore, demersal/benthic decapodiform lineages, provides further support for an onshore to offshore model of decapodiform evolution.","[Lindgren, Annie R.] Portland State Univ, Ctr Life Extreme Environm, Dept Biol, 1719 SW 10th Ave,SRTC Rm 246, Portland, OR 97201 USA; [Pratt, Abigail; Anderson, Frank E.] Southern Illinois Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Carbondale, IL 62901 USA; [Vecchione, Michael] Natl Museum Nat Hist, NMFS Natl Systemat Lab, Washington, DC 20560 USA","Portland State University; Southern Illinois University System; Southern Illinois University; Smithsonian Institution; Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA","Lindgren, AR (corresponding author), Portland State Univ, Ctr Life Extreme Environm, Dept Biol, 1719 SW 10th Ave,SRTC Rm 246, Portland, OR 97201 USA.;Anderson, FE (corresponding author), Southern Illinois Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Carbondale, IL 62901 USA.","arl3@pdx.edu; abigail.pratt@siu.edu; VECCHIOM@si.edu; feander@siu.edu","","Vecchione, Michael/0000-0002-8287-5390; Pratt, Abigail/0000-0001-8560-2649; Anderson, Frank/0000-0002-5786-0314","National Science Foundation [ABI-1759906, DEB-103651]; Portland State University; Oregon State Oceangoing Research Vessel grant","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Portland State University; Oregon State Oceangoing Research Vessel grant","This research is based in part upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. ABI-1759906 to Indiana University and DEB-103651 to Frank E.

We analyze 15 nuclear DNA microsatellite loci for the zebra mussel and 10 for the quagga mussel. Results indicate that the Hudson River and Lake Erie zebra mussel populations slightly diverge in genetic compositions, and possess similar overall genetic diversity levels. The allelic composition of the Hudson River zebra mussel population significantly changed during the middle time period (2003) analyzed, suggesting genetic replacement. Yet, its overall levels of genetic diversity levels have stayed similar. In contrast, the Hudson River's quagga mussel population has remained genetically consistent over time in both composition and diversity. Lake Erie's zebra mussel population underwent slight change in allelic composition and increased in genetic diversity from the earliest timepoint, suggesting allelic supplementation from newly arriving propagules. In contrast, Lake Erie's quagga mussel population has remained genetically consistent over time. The genetic composition of Lake Eric zebra mussel veliger larvae sampled in 2016 differed from its aduilt samples, attributable to gene flow from other areas and genetic admixture. Overall findings indicate that invasive populations may undergo significant genetic divergence or remain consistent over time, whose patterns may differ across their ranges and between related species. The population dynamics underlying their invasional successes thus may be complex.","[Marshall, Nathaniel T.] Univ Toledo, Genet & Genom Grp, Dept Environm Sci, Toledo, OH 43606 USA; [Marshall, Nathaniel T.; Stepien, Carol A.] NOAA, Pacific Marine Environm Lab, Genet & Genom Grp, 7600 Sand Point Way NE, Seattle, WA 98115 USA","University System of Ohio; University of Toledo; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA","Stepien, CA (corresponding author), NOAA, Pacific Marine Environm Lab, Genet & Genom Grp, 7600 Sand Point Way NE, Seattle, WA 98115 USA.","carol.stepien@noaa.gov","Stepien, Carol/GWU-8631-2022","Marshall, Nathaniel/0000-0002-0548-4273","USEPA Great Lakes Restoration Initiative [GL-00E01289]; Hudson River Foundation Bain Fellowship; International Association for Great Lakes Research scholarship","USEPA Great Lakes Restoration Initiative; Hudson River Foundation Bain Fellowship; International Association for Great Lakes Research scholarship","The research was funded by the USEPA Great Lakes Restoration Initiative GL-00E01289, for Invasive Invertebrate Species Prevention, Detection, and Control: A New Next Generation Sequencing Assay to C.A.S.; which was subawarded in part to the University of Washington Joint Institute for the Study of the Atmosphere and Ocean (JISAO) to the new Genetics and Genomics Group headed by C.A.S. at PMEL.

Their fixed carbon supports heterotrophs deeper in the mat, notably the second most abundant organism, Candidatus Ferristratum sp. (uncultivated gen. nov.) from the uncharacterized DTB120 phylum. Candidatus Ferristratum sp., described using nine high-quality metagenome-assembled genomes with similar distributions of genes, expressed nitrate reduction genes narGH and the iron oxidation gene cyc2 in situ and in response to Fe(II) in a shipboard incubation, suggesting it is an anaerobic nitrate-reducing iron oxidizer. Candidatus Ferristratum sp. lacks a full denitrification pathway, relying on Zetaproteobacteria to remove intermediates like nitrite. Thus, at LoModified Letter Turned Commaihi, anaerobic iron oxidizers coexist with and are dependent on aerobic iron oxidizers. In total, our work shows how key community members work together to connect iron oxidation with carbon and nitrogen cycling, thus driving the biogeochemistry of exported fluids.","[McAllister, Sean M.; Vandzura, Rebecca; Chan, Clara S.] Univ Delaware, Sch Marine Sci & Policy, Newark, DE 19716 USA; [Keffer, Jessica L.; Chan, Clara S.] Univ Delaware, Dept Earth Sci, Newark, DE 19716 USA; [Polson, Shawn W.] Univ Delaware, Ctr Bioinformat & Computat Biol, Newark, DE USA; [McAllister, Sean M.] Univ Washington, Cooperat Inst Climate Ocean & Ecosyst Studies, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [McAllister, Sean M.] NOAA, Pacific Marine Environm Lab, 7600 Sand Point Way Ne, Seattle, WA 98115 USA","University of Delaware; University of Delaware; University of Delaware; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA","Chan, CRS (corresponding author), Univ Delaware, Sch Marine Sci & Policy, Newark, DE 19716 USA.;Chan, CRS (corresponding author), Univ Delaware, Dept Earth Sci, Newark, DE 19716 USA.","cschan@udel.edu","Keffer, Jessica/ABC-1636-2020; Chan, Clara/B-6420-2011; Polson, Shawn/B-7696-2011","Chan, Clara/0000-0003-1810-4994; Polson, Shawn/0000-0002-3398-6932; Keffer, Jessica/0000-0002-0302-3588; McAllister, Sean/0000-0001-6654-3495","SWP; NSF [OCE-1155290, EAR-1833525]; NIGMS [P20 GM103446]; Delaware Space Grant Fellowships (NASA) [NNX10AN63H]; University of Delaware Dissertation Fellowship - Delaware INBRE [NIH NIGMS P20 GM103446]; Delaware Biotechnology Institute; ONR [N00014-17-1-2640]; NASA [128257, NNX10AN63H] Funding Source: Federal RePORTER","SWP; NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NIGMS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS)); Delaware Space Grant Fellowships (NASA); University of Delaware Dissertation Fellowship - Delaware INBRE; Delaware Biotechnology Institute; ONR(United States Department of DefenseUnited States NavyOffice of Naval Research); NASA(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA))","SMM and CSC conceived of and designed the study, with support from SWP.

Coral-associated bacteria affect holobiont health via nutrient cycling, metabolic exchanges and pathogen exclusion, yet it is not fully understood how bacterial community shifts affect holobiont health and physiology. In this study, a combination of antibiotics (ampicillin, streptomycin and ciprofloxacin) was used to disrupt the bacterial communities of 14 colonies of the reef framework-building corals Pocillopora meandrina and P. verrucosa, originally collected from Panama and hosting diverse algal symbionts (family Symbiodiniaceae). Symbiodiniaceae photochemical efficiencies and holobiont oxygen consumption (as proxies for coral health) were measured throughout a 5-day exposure. Antibiotics altered bacterial community composition and reduced alpha and beta diversity, however, several bacteria persisted, leading to the hypothesis that these bacteria are either antibiotics resistant or occupy internal niches that are shielded from antibiotics. While antibiotics did not affect Symbiodiniaceae photochemical efficiency, antibiotics-treated corals had lower oxygen consumption rates. RNAseq revealed that antibiotics increased expression of Pocillopora immunity and stress response genes at the expense of cellular maintenance and metabolism functions. Together, these results reveal that antibiotic disruption of corals' native bacteria negatively impacts holobiont health by decreasing oxygen consumption and activating host immunity without directly impairing Symbiodiniaceae photosynthesis, underscoring the critical role of coral-associated bacteria in holobiont health. They also provide a baseline for future experiments that manipulate Pocillopora corals' symbioses by first reducing the diversity and complexity of coral-associated bacteria.","[Connelly, Michael T.; Snyder, Grace; Gillette, Phillip R.; Baker, Andrew C.; Traylor-Knowles, Nikki] Univ Miami Rosenstiel, Dept Marine Biol & Ecol, Sch Marine Atmospher & Earth Sci, Miami, FL USA; [Palacio-Castro, Ana M.] Univ Miami, Cooperat Inst Marine & Atmospher Studies, Miami, FL USA; [Palacio-Castro, Ana M.] NOAA, Atlantic Oceanog & Meteorol Lab, Miami, FL USA; [Traylor-Knowles, Nikki] Univ Miami Rosenstiel, Sch Marine Atmospher & Earth Sci, Dept Marine Biol & Ecol, 4600 Rickenbacker Causeway, Miami, FL 33149 USA","University of Miami; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Atlantic Oceanographic & Meteorological Laboratory (AOML)","Traylor-Knowles, N (corresponding author), Univ Miami Rosenstiel, Sch Marine Atmospher & Earth Sci, Dept Marine Biol & Ecol, 4600 Rickenbacker Causeway, Miami, FL 33149 USA.","ntraylorknowles@earth.miami.edu","Palacio-Castro, Ana/AAI-9619-2020; Traylor-Knowles, Nikki/D-4354-2012","Traylor-Knowles, Nikki/0000-0002-4906-4537; Connelly, Michael/0000-0002-2084-4222; Snyder, Grace/0000-0003-3756-8540; Palacio-Castro, Ana M./0000-0002-0821-0286","2019 RSMAS David Rowland Fellowship; National Science Foundation Award [1951826]","2019 RSMAS David Rowland Fellowship; National Science Foundation Award(National Science Foundation (NSF))","We would like to thank Dr. Stephanie Rosales for bioinformatics assistance and NOAA's Ocean Chemistry and Ecosystems Division for the provision of the optical respirometer.

To further this and other blue whale-related research, we report a reference-quality, long-read-based genome assembly of this fascinating species. We assembled the genome from PacBio long reads and utilized Illumina/10x, optical maps, and Hi-C data for scaffolding, polishing, and manual curation. We also provided long read RNA-seq data to facilitate the annotation of the assembly by NCBI and Ensembl. Additionally, we annotated both haplotypes using TOGA and measured the genome size by flow cytometry. We then compared the blue whale genome with other cetaceans and artiodactyls, including vaquita (Phocoena sinus), the world's smallest cetacean, to investigate blue whale's unique biological traits. We found a dramatic amplification of several genes in the blue whale genome resulting from a recent burst in segmental duplications, though the possible connection between this amplification and giant body size requires further study. We also discovered sites in the insulin-like growth factor-1 gene correlated with body size in cetaceans. Finally, using our assembly to examine the heterozygosity and historical demography of Pacific and Atlantic blue whale populations, we found that the genomes of both populations are highly heterozygous and that their genetic isolation dates to the last interglacial period. Taken together, these results indicate how a high-quality, annotated blue whale genome will serve as an important resource for biology, evolution, and conservation research.","[Bukhman, Yury, V; Chu, Li-Fang; Antosiewicz-Bourget, Jessica; Mamott, Daniel; Argus, Cara; Bolin, Jennifer; Steill, John; Swanson, Scott A.; Ionkov, Alexander; Raja, Kalpana; Thomson, James A.; Stewart, Ron] Morgridge Inst Res, Regenerat Biol, Madison, WI 53715 USA; [Morin, Phillip A.; Lang, Aimee] NOAA, Southwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Meyer, Susanne; Gonzales, Maylie; Toh, Huishi] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Neurosci Res Inst, Santa Barbara, CA USA; [Chu, Li-Fang] Univ Calgary, Dept Comparat Biol & Expt Med, Calgary, AB, Canada; [Jacobsen, Jeff K.] VE Enterprises, Arcata, CA USA; [Berres, Mark E.] Univ Wisconsin Madison, Univ Wisconsin Biotechnol Ctr, Bioinformat Resource Ctr, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Fedrigo, Olivier; Jarvis, Erich D.] Rockefeller Univ, Vertebrate Genome Lab, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Jiang, Peng] Cleveland State Univ, Ctr Gene Regulat Hlth & Dis GRHD, Cleveland, OH USA; [Jiang, Peng] Cleveland State Univ, Dept Biol Geol & Environm Sci, Cleveland, OH USA; [Jiang, Peng] Case Western Reserve Univ, Ctr RNA Sci & Therapeut, Sch Med, Cleveland, OH USA; [Rhie, Arang; Phillippy, Adam M.] Natl Human Genome Res Inst, Genome Informat Sect, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Formenti, Giulio; Jarvis, Erich D.] Rockefeller Univ, Lab Neurogenet Language, HHMI, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Harris, Robert S.] Penn State Univ, Dept Biol, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Wood, Jonathan M.

Yet, such exposures in the marine environment are invariably accompanied by a return of environmental CO2 to atmospheric baselines. This understudied phenomenon has the potential to cause a respiratory alkalosis that would necessitate base excretion. Here we sought to explore this question and the associated physiological mechanisms that may accompany base excretions using the red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus). As expected, when high pCO(2) (15,000 mu atm CO2) acclimated red drum were transferred to normal pCO(2), their net H+ excretion shifted from positive (0.157 +/- 0.044 mu mol g(-1) h(-1)) to negative (-0.606 +/- 0.116 mu mol g(-1) h(-1)) in the 2 h post-transfer period. Net H+ excretion returned to control rates during the 3 to 24 h flux period. Gene expression and enzyme activity assays demonstrated that while the acidosis resulted in significant changes in several relevant transporters, no significant changes accompanied the alkalosis phase. Confocal microscopy was used to assess alkalosis-stimulated translocation of V-type H+ ATPase to the basolateral membrane previously seen in other marine species; however, no apparent translocation was observed. Overall, these data demonstrate that fluctuations in environmental CO2 result in both acidic and alkalotic respiratory disturbances; however, red drum maintain sufficient regulatory capacity to accommodate base excretion. Furthermore, this work does not support a role for basolateral VHA translocation in metabolic compensation from a systemic alkalosis in teleosts.","[Lonthair, Joshua; Dichiera, Angelina M.; Esbaugh, Andrew J.] Univ Texas Austin, Marine Sci Inst, Port Aransas, TX 78373 USA; [Lonthair, Joshua] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Environm Conservat, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Lonthair, Joshua] NOAA, Fisheries Resources Div, Southwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv NMFS, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA","University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA","Lonthair, J (corresponding author), NOAA, Fisheries Resources Div, Southwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv NMFS, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.","jlonthair@utexas.edu","Esbaugh, Andrew/N-4452-2017","Lonthair, Joshua/0000-0002-0400-3458","National Science Foundation [EF 1315290]; Coastal Conservation Association (CCA) Texas, University of Texas at Austin: Summer Recruitment Fellowship; University of Texas at Austin Marine Science Institute - Lund Endowment","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Coastal Conservation Association (CCA) Texas, University of Texas at Austin: Summer Recruitment Fellowship; University of Texas at Austin Marine Science Institute - Lund Endowment","This work was funded by a National Science Foundation grant (EF 1315290) to AJE.

N-e is the evolutionary analog of the number of individuals (or adults) in the population, N. Whereas ecological consequences of population size depend on N, evolutionary consequences (rates of loss of genetic diversity and increase in inbreeding; relative effectiveness of selection) depend on N-e. Formal definitions typically relate effective size to a key population genetic parameter, such as loss of heterozygosity or variance in allele frequency. However, for practical application to real populations, it is more useful to define N-e in terms of 3 demographic parameters: number of potential parents (adult N), and mean and variance in offspring number. Defined this way, N-e determines the rate of random genetic drift across the entire genome in the offspring generation. Other evolutionary forces (mutation, migration, selection)-together with factors such as variation in recombination rate-can also affect genetic variation, and this leads to heterogeneity across the genome in observed rates of genetic change. For some, it has been convenient to interpret this heterogeneity in terms of heterogeneity in N-e, but unfortunately, this has muddled the concepts of genetic drift and effective population size. A commonly repeated misconception is that N-e is the number of parents that actually contribute genes to the next generation (N-P). In reality, N-P can be smaller or larger than N-e, and the N-P/N-e ratio depends on the sex ratio, the mean and variance in offspring number, and whether inbreeding or variance N-e is of interest.","[Waples, Robin S.] NOAA, Northwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Seattle, WA 98112 USA","National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA","Waples, RS (corresponding author), NOAA, Northwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Seattle, WA 98112 USA.","robin.waples@noaa.gov","Waples, Robin/K-1126-2016","","","","",NA,48,34,35,6,34,"OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC","CARY","JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA","0022-1503","1465-7333","","J HERED","J.

In this study, jellyfish were collected from Haruta-ike, an artificial pond in Chikuma City, Nagano (Japan). Medusae were identified as Craspedacusta sowerbii using morphological and molecular techniques. Despite the existence of Haruta-ike since prior to the Edo era (ca. 1603), this work represents the first published record of freshwater jellyfish in this pond. Herein, we report on the novel swimming behavior documented in this population, which includes both male and female C. sowerbii medusae. Additionally, we discuss the life cycle of polyps reared in culture from Machikane-ike, a pond in Osaka for which we have published the first complete mitochondrial genome of C. sowerbii from Japan. Finally, we report on the morphology and life cycle of the rare Japanese freshwater jellyfish Astrohydra japonica in Lake Biwa (Shiga), documented only a few times in the 40 years since its original discovery in Japan. The results of our robust phylogenetic analysis using the 16S rRNA gene and COI markers of C. sowerbii and A. japonica in this study and for C. sowerbii material from Singapore, together with all publicly available sequences for these markers for the two species worldwide, revealed two major C. sowerbii clades suggesting the Nagano and Osaka populations originated from two distinct introduction events. This collaborative research was made possible through international collaborations among multiple research facilities, museums and one wildlife reserve.","[Peterson, Miles, I] Shinshu Univ, Dept Sci & Technol, 6 Ro Nishinagano, Nagano 3808544, Japan; [Tan, Kei Chloe] Tohoku Univ, Fac Agr, Aoba Ku, 468-1 Aramaki Aza Aoba, Sendai, Miyagi 9808572, Japan; [Collins, Allen] Natl Oceanog & Atmospher Adm, Natl Systemat Lab, Nat Hist, MR 0153,10th & Constitut Ave NW, Washington, DC 20560 USA; [Collins, Allen; Ames, Cheryl Lewis] Smithsonian Natl Museum Nat Hist, Nat Hist, MR 0163,10th & Constitut Ave NW, Washington, DC 20560 USA; [Kitano, Satoshi] Nagano Environm Conservat Res Inst, 2054-120 Kitagou, Nagano 2810075, Japan; [Kusuoka, Yasushi; Suzuki, Takahito G.] Lake Biwa Museum, 1091 Oroahimo, Kusatsu, Shiga 5250001, Japan; [Migita, Masao] Shiga Univ, Fac Educ, 2-5-1 Hiratsu, Otsu, Shiga 5200862, Japan; [Iesa, Iffah] Natl Univ Singapore, Lee Kong Chian Nat Hist Museum, 2 Conservatory Dr, Singapore 117377, Singapore; [Pirro, Stacy] Iridian Genomes, 6213 Swords Way, Bethesda, MD 20817 USA; [Lindsay, Dhugal] Japan Agcy Marine Earth Sci & Technol JAMSTEC, Inst Extra Cutting Edge Sci & Technol Avant Garde, 2-15 Natsushima Cho, Yokosuka, Kanagawa 2370061, Japan; [Ames, Cheryl Lewis] Tohoku Univ, Grad Sch Agr Sci, Aoba Ku, 468-1 Aramaki Aza Aoba, Sendai, Miyagi 9808572, Japan","Shinshu University; Tohoku University; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Smithsonian Institution; Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History; Shiga University; National University of Singapore; Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science & Technology (JAMSTEC); Tohoku University","Peterson, MI (corresponding author), Shinshu Univ, Dept Sci & Technol, 6 Ro Nishinagano, Nagano 3808544, Japan.","milesipeterson@gmail.com","Ames, Cheryl/T-2647-2019; Collins, Allen/A-7944-2008","Lewis Ames, Cheryl/0000-0003-1132-6834; Collins, Allen/0000-0002-3664-9691; Peterson, Miles/0000-0001-6187-7242; Tan, Kei Chloe/0009-0002-7458-4312","Research Fellowship from Japan Society for the Promotion of Science; Tohoku University President Fellowship; Tohoku University TUMUG Gender Equality Promotion Start-Up Grant 2019-2020; IRIDIAN Genomes; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [20J20656] Funding Source: KAKEN","Research Fellowship from Japan Society for the Promotion of Science; Tohoku University President Fellowship; Tohoku University TUMUG Gender Equality Promotion Start-Up Grant 2019-2020; IRIDIAN Genomes; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","We thank Chikuma City for their agreement to allow sampling of jellyfish at Haruta-ike.

The American Kestrel (Falco sparverius) is a widespread and highly diverse species with 17 total subspecies, only 2 of which are found north of U.S./Mexico border (F. s. paulusis restricted to southeastern United States, whileF. s. sparveriusbreeds across the remainder of the U.S. and Canadian distribution). In many parts of their U.S. and Canadian range, American Kestrels have been declining, but it has been difficult to interpret demographic trends without a clearer understanding of gene flow among populations. Here we sequence the first American Kestrel genome and scan the genome of 197 individuals from 12 sampling locations across the United States and Canada in order to identify population structure. To validate signatures of population structure and fill in sampling gaps across the U.S. and Canadian range, we screened 192 outlier loci in an additional 376 samples from 34 sampling locations. Overall, our analyses support the existence of 5 genetically distinct populations of American Kestrels-eastern, western, Texas, Florida, and Alaska. Interestingly, we found that while our genome-wide genetic data support the existence of previously described subspecies boundaries in the United States and Canada, genetic differences across the sampled range correlate more with putative migratory phenotypes (resident, long-distance, and short-distance migrants) rather than a priori described subspecies boundaries per se. Based on our results, we suggest the resulting 5 genetically distinct populations serve as the foundation for American Kestrel conservation and management in the face of future threats.","[Ruegg, Kristen C.; Bossu, Christen M.] Colorado State Univ, Biol Dept, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Ruegg, Kristen C.; Bossu, Christen M.; Bay, Rachael A.; Smith, Thomas B.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Inst Environm & Sustainabil, Ctr Trop Res, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Brinkmeyer, Michaela; Heath, Julie A.] Boise State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Boise, ID 83725 USA; [Brinkmeyer, Michaela; Heath, Julie A.] Boise State Univ, Raptor Res Ctr, Boise, ID 83725 USA; [Bay, Rachael A.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Evolut & Ecol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Anderson, Eric C.] Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Fisheries Ecol Div, Southwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Santa Cruz, CA USA; [Boal, Clint W.] Texas Tech Univ, US Geol Survey, Texas Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA; [Dawson, Russell D.] Univ Northern British Columbia, Ecosyst Sci & Management Program, Prince George, BC, Canada; [Eschenbauch, Amber] Cent Wisconsin Kestrel Res, Amherst, WI USA; [McClure, Christopher J.

The subfamily Halobatinae Bianchi, 1896 is particularly interesting because some species have adapted to life on the open ocean-a habitat where insects are very rarely found. Several attempts have been made to reconstruct the phylogenetic hypotheses of this subfamily, but the use of a few partial gene sequences recovered only a handful of well-supported relationships, thus limiting evolutionary inferences. Fortunately, the emergence of high-throughput sequencing technologies has enabled the recovery of more genetic markers for phylogenetic inference. We applied genome skimming to obtain mitochondrial and nuclear genes from low-coverage whole-genome sequencing of 85 specimens for reconstructing a well-supported phylogeny, with particular emphasis on Halobatinae. Our study confirmed that Metrocorini Matsuda, 1960, is paraphyletic, whereas Esakia Lundblad, 1933, and Ventidius Distant, 1910, are more closely related to Halobatini Bianchi, 1896, than Metrocoris Mayr, 1865, and Eurymetra Esaki, 1926. We also found that Ventidius is paraphyletic and in need of a taxonomic revision. Ancestral state reconstruction suggests that Halobatinae evolved progressively from limnic to coastal habitats, eventually attaining a marine lifestyle, especially in the genus Halobates Eschscholtz, 1822, where the oceanic lifestyle evolved thrice. Our results demonstrate that genome skimming is a powerful and straightforward approach to recover genetic loci for robust phylogenetic analysis in non-model insects.

The goal of this study was to build upon previous research to better understand social and genetic structure of BBES dolphins. Photo-identification data from 2010-2019 were analysed with SOCPROG to identify dolphin social clusters. Genetic analyses were conducted on samples obtained during remote biopsy surveys and health assessments (2010-2018) to assess if identified social clusters were congruent with genetic clustering results, and to evaluate relatedness and gene flow within and between social and genetic clusters. Spatial analyses of the cumulative photo-identification sighting histories from each cluster were also used to determine their geographic range and degree of overlap within the Barataria Basin. Social analyses identified four distinct clusters with some degree of geographic overlap and similar utilization distributions as the three identified genetic clusters. Dolphins in the Barataria Basin were confirmed to be genetically differentiated from those in adjacent coastal waters. In general, genetic analyses differentiate distinct dolphin communities established through long-term (generational) preferential breeding behaviour. In contrast, social associations can be more fluid over the short-term, may change in response to habitat or predator/prey changes, and strong associations can be formed between a mix of related and unrelated individuals. The combination of genetic and social methodologies is valuable for developing a better understanding of complex dolphin social interactions and provides unique insights into dolphin behaviour that can be important for developing effective management strategies.","[Speakman, Todd R.; Balmer, Brian C.; Quigley, Brian M.; Schwacke, Lori H.; Takeshita, Ryan; Zolman, Eric S.] Natl Marine Mammal Fdn, San Diego, CA 92106 USA; [Wilcox, Lynsey A.; Paterson, Corinne; Vollmer, Nicole L.; Rosel, Patricia E.] NOAA, Marine Mammal & Turtle Div, Southeast Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Lafayette, LA USA; [Balmer, Brian C.] Dolphin Relief & Res, Clancy, MT USA; [Barry, Kevin P.; Sinclair, Carrie] NOAA, Marine Mammal & Turtle Div, Southeast Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Pascagoula, MS USA; [Paterson, Corinne; Vollmer, Nicole L.] Univ Miami, Cooperat Inst Marine & Atmospher Studies, Rosenstiel Sch Marine Atmospher & Earth Sci, Miami, FL USA","National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of Miami","Speakman, TR (corresponding author), Natl Marine Mammal Fdn, San Diego, CA 92106 USA.","todd.speakman@nmmf.org","Balmer, Brian/JEO-9639-2023","Takeshita, Ryan/0000-0003-2748-8803; Balmer, Brian/0000-0001-9734-4042; Wilcox, Lynsey/0000-0001-9824-879X; Schwacke, Lori/0000-0003-0434-5332; Speakman, Todd/0000-0003-0421-4180; Quigley, Brian/0000-0001-8314-9588; Paterson, Corinne/0000-0002-0704-8555","Office of Naval Research Marine Mammal Biology Program [N000141712868]; U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) [N000141712868] Funding Source: U.S. Department of Defense (DOD)","Office of Naval Research Marine Mammal Biology Program(United States Department of DefenseUnited States NavyOffice of Naval Research); U.S. Department of Defense (DOD)(United States Department of Defense)","We thank the Office of Naval Research Marine Mammal Biology Program for providing support for T.

To identify relevant thresholds for echinoderms, we undertook a three-step data synthesis, focused on California Current Ecosystem (CCE) species. First, literature characterizing echinoderm responses to OA was compiled, creating a dataset comprised of >12,000 datapoints from 41 studies. Analysis of this data set demonstrated responses related to physiology, behavior, growth and development, and increased mortality in the larval and adult stages to low pH exposure. Second, statistical analyses were conducted on selected pathways to identify OA thresholds specific to duration, taxa, and depth-related life stage. Exposure to reduced pH led to impaired responses across a range of physiology, behavior, growth and development, and mortality endpoints for both larval and adult stages. Third, through discussions and synthesis, the expert panel identified a set of eight duration-dependent, life stage, and habitat-dependent pH thresholds and assigned each a confidence score based on quantity and agreement of evidence. The thresholds for these effects ranged within pH from 7.20 to 7.74 and duration from 7 to 30 days, all of which were characterized with either medium or low confidence. These thresholds yielded a risk range from early warning to lethal impacts, providing the foundation for consistent interpretation of OA monitoring data or numerical ocean model simulations to support climate change marine vulnerability assessments and evaluation of ocean management strategies. As a demonstration, two echinoderm thresholds were applied to simulations of a CCE numerical model to visualize the effects of current state of pH conditions on potential habitat.","[Bednarsek, Nina; Kessouri, Faycal; Roethler, Miranda; Sutula, Martha; Weisberg, Stephen B.] Southern Calif Coastal Water Res Project, Costa Mesa, CA 92626 USA; [Bednarsek, Nina] Natl Inst Biol, Ljubljana, Slovenia; [Calosi, Piero] Univ Quebec Rimouski, Dept Biol Chim & Geog, Rimouski, PQ, Canada; [Feely, Richard A.] NOAA, Pacific Marine Environm Lab, 7600 Sand Point Way Ne, Seattle, WA 98115 USA; [Ambrose, Richard] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Environm Hlth Sci, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Byrne, Maria] Univ Sydney, Sch Life & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Chan, Kit Yu Karen] Swarthmore Coll, Biol Dept, Swarthmore, PA 19081 USA; [Dupont, Sam] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, Gothenburg, Sweden; [Padilla-Gamino, Jacqueline L.] Univ Washington, Sch Aquat & Fishery Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Spicer, John, I] Univ Plymouth, Marine Biol & Ecol Res Ctr, Sch Biol & Marine Sci, Plymouth, Devon, England","Southern California Coastal Water Research Project; National Institute of Biology - Slovenia; University of Quebec; Universite du Quebec a Rimouski; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; University of Sydney; Swarthmore College; University of Gothenburg; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; University of Plymouth","Bednarsek, N (corresponding author), Southern Calif Coastal Water Res Project, Costa Mesa, CA 92626 USA.;Bednarsek, N (corresponding author), Natl Inst Biol, Ljubljana, Slovenia.","ninab@sccwrp.org","bednarsek, nina/AAM-7748-2021; Chan, Karen/E-4041-2015; Padilla-Gamino, Jacqueline/AGL-6020-2022; Kessouri, Faycal/U-2718-2018; Byrne, Maria/K-6355-2016","Chan, Kit Yu Karen/0000-0002-7775-4383; Kessouri, Faycal/0000-0002-8752-9200; Sutula, Martha/0000-0001-8051-6274; Byrne, Maria/0000-0002-8902-9808","California Ocean Protection Council [C0302500]","California Ocean Protection Council","This research was supported by the California Ocean Protection Council, grant number C0302500.

This is particularly true in species with high dispersal capacity, such as migratory whales, where patterns of connectivity could change rapidly. Here we build on a previous long-term, large-scale collaboration on southern right whales (Eubalaena australis) to combine new (n(new)) and published (n(pub)) mitochondrial (mtDNA) and microsatellite genetic data from all major wintering grounds and, uniquely, the South Georgia (Islas Georgias del Sur: SG) feeding grounds. Specifically, we include data from Argentina (n(pub) mtDNA/microsatellite = 208/46), Brazil (n(new) mtDNA/microsatellite = 50/50), South Africa (n(new) mtDNA/microsatellite = 66/77, n(pub) mtDNA/microsatellite = 350/47), Chile-Peru (n(new) mtDNA/microsatellite = 1/1), the Indo-Pacific (n pub mtDNA/microsatellite = 769/126), and SG (n(pub) mtDNA/microsatellite = 8/0, n(new) mtDNA/microsatellite = 3/11) to investigate the position of previously unstudied habitats in the migratory network: Brazil, SG, and Chile-Peru. These new genetic data show connectivity between Brazil and Argentina, exemplified by weak genetic differentiation and the movement of 1 genetically identified individual between the South American grounds. The single sample from Chile-Peru had an mtDNA haplotype previously only observed in the Indo-Pacific and had a nuclear genotype that appeared admixed between the Indo-Pacific and South Atlantic, based on genetic clustering and assignment algorithms.The SG samples were clearly South Atlantic and were more similar to the South American than the South African wintering grounds. This study highlights how international collaborations are critical to provide context for emerging or recovering regions, like the SG feeding ground, as well as those that remain critically endangered, such as Chile-Peru.","[Carroll, Emma L.] Univ Auckland, Sch Biol Sci, Auckland, New Zealand; [Carroll, Emma L.; Gaggiotti, Oscar E.] Univ St Andrews, Sch Biol, St Andrews, Fife, Scotland; [Ott, Paulo H.] Grp Estudos Mamiferos Aquat Rio Grande Sul, Torres, RS, Brazil; [Ott, Paulo H.; Oliveira, Larissa] Univ Estadual Rio Grande do Sul, Osorio, RS, Brazil; [McMillan, Louise F.] Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Math & Stat, POB 600, Wellington, New Zealand; [Vernazzani, Barbara Galletti; Cabrera, Elsa] Ctr Conservac Cetacea, Casilla 19178 Correo 19, Santiago, Chile; [Neveceralova, Petra; Hulva, Pavel] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Sci, Dept Zool, Prague, Czech Republic; [Neveceralova, Petra] Ivanhoe Sea Safaris, 83 Vyfer Str, Gansbaai, South Africa; [Neveceralova, Petra] Dyer Isl Conservat Trust, Great White House, Kleinbaai, Gansbaai, South Africa; [Vermeulen, Els] Univ Pretoria, Mammal Res Inst, Dept Zool & Entomol, Whale Unit, Hatfield, South Africa; [Andriolo, Artur] Univ Fed Juiz de Fora, Inst Ciencias Biol, Dept Zool, Campus Univ, BR-36036900 Juiz De Fora, MG, Brazil; [Andriolo, Artur] Inst Aqualie, Juiz De Fora, MG, Brazil; [Baker, C.

With evidence of potential adverse effects as identified in human and laboratory studies, there is a concern for bottlenose dolphin health. This study investigated potential correlations between serum hormone levels and urinary phthalate metabolite concentrations to begin to understand whether health effects would be expected in dolphins. We observed a positive relationship between free thyroxine and mono(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP) for both adult female and male dolphins, suggesting potential associations with normal thyroid production. Phthalates are chemical esters used to enhance desirable properties of plastics, personal care, and cleaning products. Phthalates have shown ubiquitous environmental contamination due to their abundant use and propensity to leach from products to which they are added. Following exposure, phthalates are rapidly metabolized and excreted through urine. Common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) sampled from Sarasota Bay, Florida, have demonstrated prevalent di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) exposure indicated by detectable urinary mono(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP) concentrations. Widespread exposure is concerning due to evidence of endocrine disruption from human and laboratory studies. To better understand how phthalate exposure may impact dolphin health, correlations between relevant hormone levels and detectable urinary MEHP concentrations were examined. Hormone concentrations measured via blood serum samples included triiodothyronine (T3), total thyroxine (T4), and free thyroxine (FT4). Urinary MEHP concentrations were detected in 56% of sampled individuals (n = 50; mean = 8.13 ng/mL; s.d. = 15.99 ng/mL). Adult female and male FT4 was significantly correlated with urinary MEHP concentrations (adult female Kendall's tau = 0.36, p = 0.04; adult male Kendall's tau = 0.42, p = 0.02).

Such variants are becoming easier to find due, in large part, to the increase in the amount of genome-wide sequence data in nonmodel organisms. The salmonids (salmon, trout, and charr) are a taxonomic group with abundant genome-wide datasets due to their importance in aquaculture, fisheries, and variation in multiple ecologically important life-history traits. Previous research on rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) has documented a large pericentric (similar to 55 Mb) chromosomal inversion (CI) on chromosome 5 (Omy05) and a second smaller (similar to 14 Mb) chromosome inversion on Omy20. While the Omy05 inversion appears to be associated with multiple adaptive traits, the inversion on Omy20 has received far less attention. In this study, we re-analyze RAD-seq and amplicon data from several populations of rainbow trout (O. mykiss) to better document the structure and geographic distribution of variation in the Omy20 CI. Moreover, we utilize phylogenomic techniques to characterize both the age- and the protein-coding gene content of the Omy20 CI. We find that the age of the Omy20 inversion dates to the early stages of O. mykiss speciation and predates the Omy05 inversion by similar to 450,000 years. The 2 CIs differ further in terms of the frequency of the homokaryotypes. While both forms of the Omy05 CI are found across the eastern Pacific, the ancestral version of the Omy20 CI is restricted to the southern portion of the species range in California. Furthermore, the Omy20 inverted haplotype is comparable in genetic diversity to the ancestral form, whereas derived CIs typically show substantially reduced genetic diversity. These data contribute to our understanding of the age and distribution of a large CI in rainbow trout and provide a framework for researchers looking to document CIs in other nonmodel species.","[Hale, Matthew C.] Texas Christian Univ, Dept Biol, Ft Worth, TX 76109 USA; [Pearse, Devon E.] NOAA, Southwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Campbell, Matthew A.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Anim Sci, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Campbell, Matthew A.] Univ Sydney, Ctr Carbon Water & Food, Brownlow Hill 2570, Australia","Texas Christian University; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of California System; University of California Davis; University of Sydney","Hale, MC (corresponding author), Texas Christian Univ, Dept Biol, Ft Worth, TX 76109 USA.","m.c.hale@tcu.edu","","Campbell, Matthew/0000-0002-5826-0329; Hale, Matthew/0000-0002-7391-2727; Pearse, Devon/0000-0003-1934-6493","","","",NA,50,1,1,3,3,"OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC","CARY","JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA","2160-1836","","","G3-GENES GENOM GENET","G3-Genes Genomes Genet.","JUN 17",2024,14,"7",NA,"","","",NA,NA,"","10.1093/g3journal/jkae100","http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/g3journal/jkae100",NA,"JUN 2024",11,"Genetics & Heredity","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Genetics & Heredity","XT6O9",38885060,"gold","","","2024-10-25","WOS:001249118100001","View Full Record in Web of Science",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

SCTLD can have up to a 61% prevalence in reefs and has affected at least 23 species of scleractinian corals. This has contributed to the regional near-extinction of at least one coral species, Dendrogyra cylindrus. Initial studies of SCTLD indicate microbial community shifts and cessation of lesion progression in response to antibiotics on some colonies. However, the etiology and abiotic sources of SCTLD transmission are unknown. To characterize SCTLD microbial signatures, we collected tissue samples from four affected coral species: Stephanocoenia intersepta, Diploria labyrinthiformis, Dichocoenia stokesii, and Meandrina meandrites. Tissue samples were from apparently healthy (AH) corals, and unaffected tissue (DU) and lesion tissue (DL) on diseased corals. Samples were collected in June 2018 from three zones: (1) vulnerable (ahead of the SCTLD disease boundary in the Lower Florida Keys), (2) endemic (post-outbreak in the Upper Florida Keys), and (3) epidemic (SCTLD was active and prevalent in the Middle Florida Keys). From each zone, sediment and water samples were also collected to identify whether they may serve as potential sources of transmission for SCTLD-associated microbes. We used 16S rRNA gene amplicon high-throughput sequencing methods to characterize the microbiomes of the coral, water, and sediment samples. We identified a relatively higher abundance of the bacteria orders Rhodobacterales and Rhizobiales in DL tissue compared to AH and DU tissue. Also, our results showed relatively higher abundances of Rhodobacterales in water from the endemic and epidemic zones compared to the vulnerable zone. Rhodobacterales and Rhizobiales identified at higher relative abundances in DL samples were also detected in sediment samples, but not in water samples. Our data indicate that Rhodobacterales and Rhizobiales may play a role in SCTLD and that sediment may be a source of transmission for Rhodobacterales and Rhizobiales associated with SCTLD lesions.","[Rosales, Stephanie M.] Univ Miami, Cooperat Inst Marine & Atmospher Studies, Miami, FL 33149 USA; [Rosales, Stephanie M.] NOAA, Atlantic Oceanog & Meteorol Lab, Miami, FL 33149 USA; [Clark, Abigail S.] Elizabeth Moore Int Ctr Coral Reef Res & Restorat, Mote Marine Lab, Summerland Key, FL USA; [Huebner, Lindsay K.; Ruzicka, Rob R.] Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservat Commiss, Fish & Wildlife Res Inst, St Petersburg, FL USA; [Muller, Erinn M.] Mote Marine Lab, Sarasota, FL 34236 USA","University of Miami; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Atlantic Oceanographic & Meteorological Laboratory (AOML); Mote Marine Laboratory & Aquarium; Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservation Commission; Mote Marine Laboratory & Aquarium","Rosales, SM (corresponding author), Univ Miami, Cooperat Inst Marine & Atmospher Studies, Miami, FL 33149 USA.;Rosales, SM (corresponding author), NOAA, Atlantic Oceanog & Meteorol Lab, Miami, FL 33149 USA.","Stephanie.Rosales@NOAA.gov","Huebner, Lindsay/AAI-9558-2020; Rosales, Stephanie/Z-4923-2019","Huebner, Lindsay/0000-0003-0413-9408; Clark, Abigail/0000-0002-0191-0933","[FKNMS-2017-100]","","We thank Ray Banister, Tiffany Boisvert, Katy Cummings, Kari Imhof, Lauri Maclaughlin, Stephanie Schopmeyer, and Jenni Stein for assistance with sample collection and processing in the field.

In reef habitats, epiphytes are often found living on host organisms, including seaweeds or corals, and can influence community composition of higher trophic level taxa. Hence, understanding how epiphytes respond to different reef substrate materials can help inform designs of substrates intentionally deployed to form artificial reefs which can encourage high biodiversity and ecological functioning. One such epiphyte, Gambierdiscus spp., is a harmful benthic dinoflagellate which produces toxins that bioaccumulate and cause ciguatera fish poisoning (CFP) when contaminated fish is consumed by humans. CFP is one of the most frequently reported seafood-associated illnesses around the world, occurring most often near tropical reefs. We surveyed the epiphytes amongst 13 natural and artificial reef sites located off the coast of North Carolina to determine the role of the reefs' foundational substrate (e.g., natural marl, steel or concrete) on structuring the epiphyte community with an emphasis on Gambierdiscus spp. abundance. No Gambierdiscus spp. were detected among the sampled reefs, likely due to suboptimal water temperatures. An ex-situ substrate preference experiment for Gambierdiscus spp. was performed using marl to represent natural rocky reefs, and steel and concrete to represent artificial reefs. Experimental results indicated that Gambierdiscus spp. grew fastest in the presence of marl and density decreased significantly when exposed to steel. However, steel artificial reefs had the highest average epiphyte biomass and species richness amongst the sampled reefs. 18s rRNA gene sequence analysis revealed that natural reefs were more likely to be dominated by dinoflagellates, whereas steel and concrete reefs were dominated by diatoms. We found that epiphyte composition was related to material at a phylum level, but seaweed hosts played a more significant role at the species level. These findings suggest that CFP risk is relatively low on the reefs studied but natural reefs would likely be preferentially colonized by Gambierdiscus spp. should ambient conditions become appropriate.","[Lim, Prisca; Hall, Nathan S.] Univ N Carolina, Inst Marine Sci, Morehead City, NC 28557 USA; [Paxton, Avery B.; Taylor, J.

Warming and hypoxia can interact physiologically, but their combined effects during fish development remain poorly studied, particularly stage-specific effects and potential carry-over effects. To test the impacts ofwarmwater temperature and hypoxia as individual and combined developmental stressors, late fall-run Chinook salmon embryos were reared in 10 treatments from fertilization through hatching with two temperatures [10 degrees C (ambient) and 14 degrees C (warm)], two dissolved oxygen saturation levels [normoxia (100% air saturation, 10.4-11.4 mg O-2/l) and hypoxia (50% saturation, 5.5 mg O-2/l)] and three exposure times (early [eyed stage], late [silver-eyed stage] and chronic [fertilization through hatching]). After hatching, all treatments were transferred to control conditions (10 degrees C and 100% air saturation) through the fry stage. To study stage-specific effects of stressor exposure we measured routine metabolic rate (RMR) at two embryonic stages, hatching success and growth. To evaluate carry-over effects, where conditions during one life stage influence performance in a later stage, RMR of all treatments was measured in control conditions at two post-hatch stages and acute stress tolerance was measured at the fry stage. We found evidence of stage-specific effects of both stressors during exposure and carry- over effects on physiological performance. Both individual stressors affected RMR, growth and developmental rate while multiple stressors late in development reduced hatching success. RMR post-hatch showed persistent effects of embryonic stressor exposure that may underlie differences observed in developmental timing and acute stress tolerance. The responses to stressors that varied by stage during development suggest that stage-specific management efforts could support salmon embryo survival. The persistent carry-over effects also indicate that considering sub-lethal effects of developmental stressor exposure may be important to understanding how climate change influences the performance of salmon across life stages.","[Del Rio, Annelise M.; Mukai, Gabriella N.; Johnson, Rachel C.; Todgham, Anne E.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Anim Sci, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Mukai, Gabriella N.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Biol, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Martin, Benjamin T.; Johnson, Rachel C.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Cooperat Inst Marine Ecosyst & Climate CIMEC, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Martin, Benjamin T.; Johnson, Rachel C.] NOAA, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Southwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, 110 Shaffer Rd, Santa Cruz, CA 95060 USA; [Martin, Benjamin T.] Univ Amsterdam, Inst Biodivers & Ecosyst Dynam, NL-1098 XH Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Fangue, Nann A.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Wildlife Fish & Conservat Biol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Israel, Joshua A.] US Bur Reclamat, Bay Delta Off, Sacramento, CA 95825 USA","University of California System; University of California Davis; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; University of California System; University of California Santa Cruz; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of Amsterdam; University of California System; University of California Davis","Todgham, AE (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Dept Anim Sci, Davis, CA 95616 USA.","todgham@ucdavis.edu","","","US Bureau of Reclamation; Delta Science Council Delta Science Program; California Sea Grant [R16AC00026]; California Agricultural Experimental Station of the University of California Davis [CA-D-ASC-2252-H, CA-D-ASC-2098]","US Bureau of Reclamation; Delta Science Council Delta Science Program; California Sea Grant; California Agricultural Experimental Station of the University of California Davis","This work was funded by the US Bureau of Reclamation in partnership with the Delta Science Council Delta Science Program and California Sea Grant (grant number R16AC00026 awarded to A.M.D.) and the California Agricultural Experimental Station of the University of California Davis (grant numbers CA-D-ASC-2252-H to A.E.T. and CA-D-ASC-2098 to N.A.F.).",NA,83,13,14,3,20,"OXFORD UNIV PRESS","OXFORD","GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","2051-1434","","","CONSERV PHYSIOL","Conserv.

In marine mammals, reports of Leptospira have predominantly been in pinnipeds, with isolated reports of infections in cetaceans. Case presentation On 28 June 2021, a 150.5 cm long female, short-beaked common dolphin (Delphinus delphis delphis) stranded alive on the coast of southern California and subsequently died. Gross necropsy revealed multifocal cortical pallor within the reniculi of the kidney, and lymphoplasmacytic tubulointerstitial nephritis was observed histologically. Immunohistochemistry confirmed Leptospira infection, and PCR followed by lfb1 gene amplicon sequencing suggested that the infecting organism was L. kirschneri. Leptospira DNA capture and enrichment allowed for whole-genome sequencing to be conducted. Phylogenetic analyses confirmed the causative agent was a previously undescribed, divergent lineage of L. kirschneri. Conclusions We report the first detection of pathogenic Leptospira in a short-beaked common dolphin, and the first detection in any cetacean in the northeastern Pacific Ocean. Renal lesions were consistent with leptospirosis in other host species, including marine mammals, and were the most significant lesions detected overall, suggesting leptospirosis as the likely cause of death. We identified the cause of the infection as L. kirschneri, a species detected only once before in a marine mammal - a northern elephant seal (Mirounga angustirostris) of the northeastern Pacific. These findings raise questions about the mechanism of transmission, given the obligate marine lifestyle of cetaceans (in contrast to pinnipeds, which spend time on land) and the commonly accepted view that Leptospira are quickly killed by salt water. They also raise important questions regarding the source of infection, and whether it arose from transmission among marine mammals or from terrestrial-to-marine spillover. Moving forward, surveillance and sampling must be expanded to better understand the extent to which Leptospira infections occur in the marine ecosystem and possible epidemiological linkages between and among marine and terrestrial host species. Generating Leptospira genomes from different host species will yield crucial information about possible transmission links, and our study highlights the power of new techniques such as DNA enrichment to illuminate the complex ecology of this important zoonotic pathogen.","[Prager, K.

Although anammox and denitrification have been relatively well studied in ODZ waters, few studies have investigated these processes in the underlying sediments. We sampled seven stations over a large geographic area along the Peru margin, spanning a water depth of 100-3240 m. At two of the central shelf stations (100 m and 325 m), we observed Thioploca, with a well-developed mat at the shallowest station (100 m). We measured sediment properties and conducted shipboard N-15-incubations of homogenized sediments to determine potential rates of anammox and denitrification and potential controlling factors at each station. Diversity of anammox bacteria based on 16S rRNA and hydrazine oxidoreductase (hzo) sequences and hzo gene abundances were measured at each station. Overall, organic C content was high across the stations (3-12%), except for two of the deepest stations (similar to 1.5%). Porewater ammonium fluxes and ammonium production rates in shipboard incubations, reflecting sediment organic carbon decomposition rates, were higher at the two central shelf stations compared to the other stations. The range in average potential rates was 2.1-80.4 nmol N cm(-3)h(-1) for denitrification and 1.8-44.2 nmol N cm(-3)h(-1) for anammox. The range in relative anammox (ra) across stations was 2.6-47.4%, with an average of 34.2%. The lowest ra was found at the shallowest shelf station with Thioploca mats and highest ammonium production rates. The ra jumped up to 45.9% at the station with the next highest ammonium production rates, corresponding to the deeper shelf station (325 m). At the other stations, ra was relatively high (39.6-47.4%), except at one station (16.3%), reflecting similar ammonium production rates due to decomposition across these stations. Anammox bacteria in the Candidatus Scalindua genus were the only anammox bacteria detected in Peru margin sediments based on 16S rRNA or hzo sequences. Copy number of hzo indicated abundant populations of anammox bacteria across the stations. However, hzo copy number did not correlate with anammox rates or ra. Overall, our results suggest that anammox contributes significantly to N-2 production in Peru margin sediments, except in shelf sediments with high decomposition rates and dense Thioploca mats.","[Rich, Jeremy J.] Univ Maine, Sch Marine Sci, Walpole, ME 04573 USA; [Rich, Jeremy J.] Univ Maine, Darling Marine Ctr, Walpole, ME 04573 USA; [Arevalo, Philip] Univ Chicago, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Chang, Bonnie X.] Univ Washington, Joint Inst Study Atmosphere & Ocean, NOAA, Pacific Marine Environm Lab, Seattle, WA 98115 USA; [Devol, Allan H.] Univ Washington, Sch Oceanog, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Ward, Bess B.] Princeton Univ, Dept Geosci, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA","University of Maine System; University of Maine Orono; University of Maine System; University of Maine Orono; University of Chicago; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; Princeton University","Rich, JJ (corresponding author), Univ Maine, Sch Marine Sci, Walpole, ME 04573 USA.;Rich, JJ (corresponding author), Univ Maine, Darling Marine Ctr, Walpole, ME 04573 USA.","jeremy.rich@maine.edu","","Ward, Bess/0000-0001-7870-2684","National Science Foundation (NSF) Microbial Biology Postdoctoral Fellowship Program [DBI-0301308]; NSF [OCE-0647981]","National Science Foundation (NSF) Microbial Biology Postdoctoral Fellowship Program(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF))","We thank the crew and science party aboard the R/V Knorr (leg 182-9) for the assistance and support.

Recent studies of niche models have identified suitable habitats for its settlement also on the east coast of the Atlantic. Considering the pelagic larval period and the high tolerance of this species to environmental variations, this study aimed to analyze the possibility of O. insularis occurrence in the West Atlantic (Sao Tome Island) through molecular analyses, dispersion, and niche models. The molecular analyses were performed using fragments of 481 bp of the mitochondrial gene (cox1) from three muscle samples collected in Sao Tome Island. The O. insularis long-range connectivity between South America and Western Africa was analyzed using a Lagrangian particle tracking model. Additionally, O. insularis records across its entire known distribution were applied to run the ecological niche model (ENM) using the Maxent algorithm. The Bayesian phylogenetic reconstruction showed that two of the three octopus sequences from Sao Tome island (Central-Western Africa) belong to a monophyletic and well-supported O. insularis clade. The third octopus sample revealed a new species related to the clade with the Octopus vulgaris species complex. The dispersal models pointed out that passive particles could potentially reach the seamounts region at Africa coast via oceanic currents (mainly the North Equatorial Countercurrent) from Sao Pedro and Sao Paulo archipelago (Central-Western Region of the Atlantic) in a period of similar to 30-60 days. This suggests that Sao Pedro and Sao Paulo archipelago could act as a potential source of paralarvae to Western Africa, although we hypothesize that this connection was more common during the Pleistocene, when sea level was around 120 m lower. In addition to the already known areas of O. insularis occurrence, the ENM pointed suitable habitats to the octopus settlement from Guinea-Bissau down to Equatorial Guinea and Gabon, and African Islands, such as Sao Tome and Principe. The new record of O. insularis in Africa raises important questions regarding regional fisheries management. Considering that O. insularis is highly tolerant to environmental variations and very adapted to warm shallow waters, there is a possibility that octopus fisheries stocks on the African coast have a mixed composition (O. vulgaris, O. insularis, and Octopus sp.) and therefore the fisheries must follow management measures suitable for each species. In addition, further studies should be carried out in order to characterize and describe the potential new octopus species found only in Sao Tome Island according to our genetic survey.","[Lima, Francoise D.; Lima, Sergio M.

However, studies of bottlenecked populations combining genomic approaches with fitness data are rare. Theory predicts that severe bottlenecks deplete genetic diversity, exacerbate inbreeding depression and decrease population viability. However, actual outcomes are complex and depend on how a species' unique demography affects its genetic load. We used population genetic and veterinary pathology data, demographic modelling, whole-genome resequencing and forward genetic simulations to investigate the genomic and fitness consequences of a near-extinction event in the northern elephant seal. We found no evidence of inbreeding depression within the contemporary population for key fitness components, including body mass, blubber thickness and susceptibility to parasites and disease. However, we detected a genomic signature of a recent extreme bottleneck (effective population size = 6; 95% confidence interval = 5.0-7.5) that will have purged much of the genetic load, potentially leading to the lack of observed inbreeding depression in our study. Our results further suggest that deleterious genetic variation strongly impacted the post-bottleneck population dynamics of the northern elephant seal. Our study provides comprehensive empirical insights into the intricate dynamics underlying species-specific responses to anthropogenic bottlenecks. Analysis of northern elephant seal populations shows no evidence of inbreeding depression, probably because a recent extreme bottleneck purged much of the genetic load.","[Hoffman, Joseph I.; Vendrami, David L.

In most cases, no single topology is reflected across the entire genome as the phylogenetic signal differs among genomic regions due to processes, such as introgression and incomplete lineage sorting. Baleen whales are among the largest vertebrates on Earth with a high dispersal potential in a relatively unrestricted habitat, the oceans. The fin whale (Balaenoptera physalus) is one of the most enigmatic baleen whale species, currently divided into four subspecies. It has been a matter of debate whether phylogeographic patterns explain taxonomic variation in fin whales. Here we present a chromosome-level whole genome analysis of the phylogenetic relationships among fin whales from multiple ocean basins. First, we estimated concatenated and consensus phylogenies for both the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes. The consensus phylogenies based upon the autosomal genome uncovered monophyletic clades associated with each ocean basin, aligning with the current understanding of subspecies division. Nevertheless, discordances were detected in the phylogenies based on the Y chromosome, mitochondrial genome, autosomal genome and X chromosome. Furthermore, we detected signs of introgression and pervasive phylogenetic discordance across the autosomal genome. This complex phylogenetic scenario could be explained by a puzzle of introgressive events, not yet documented in fin whales. Similarly, incomplete lineage sorting and low phylogenetic signal could lead to such phylogenetic discordances. Our study reinforces the pitfalls of relying on concatenated or single locus phylogenies to determine taxonomic relationships below the species level by illustrating the underlying nuances that some phylogenetic approaches may fail to capture. We emphasize the significance of accurate taxonomic delineation in fin whales by exploring crucial information revealed through genome-wide assessments.","[Furni, Fabricio; Berube, Martine; Palsboll, Per J.] Univ Groningen, Groningen Inst Evolutionary Life Sci, Marine Evolut & Conservat Grp, Groningen, Netherlands; [Secchi, Eduardo R.] Univ Fed Rio Grande FURG, Lab Ecol & Conservacao Megafauna Marinha, Inst Oceanog, Rio Grande, Brazil; [Speller, Camilla] Univ British Columbia, Dept Anthropol, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [DenDanto, Daniel] Allied Whale, Coll Atlantic, Bar Harbor, ME USA; [Ramp, Christian; Sears, Richard] Mingan Isl Cetacean Study Inc, St Lambert, PQ, Canada; [Ramp, Christian] Univ St Andrews, Scottish Oceans Inst, St Andrews, Scotland; [Larsen, Finn] Natl Inst Aquat Resources, Lyngby, Denmark; [Mizroch, Sally] US Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Natl Marine Mammal Lab, Seattle, WA USA; [Robbins, Jooke; Berube, Martine; Palsboll, Per J.] Ctr Coastal Studies, Provincetown, MA USA; [Urban, Jorge R.] Univ Autonoma Baja California, Dept Ciencias Marinas & Costeras, La Paz, Baja California, Mexico","University of Groningen; Universidade Federal do Rio Grande; University of British Columbia; University of St Andrews; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Universidad Autonoma de Baja California","Furni, F; Palsboll, PJ (corresponding author), Univ Groningen, Groningen Inst Evolutionary Life Sci, Marine Evolut & Conservat Grp, Groningen, Netherlands.","fabriciofurni@palaeome.org; palsboll@gmail.com","Palsbll, Per/L-3494-2013; Berube, Martine/IWU-4585-2023","Berube, Martine/0000-0002-1831-2657; FURNI, FABRICIO/0000-0002-2578-2753","European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme; Center for Information Technology of the University of Groningen; Brazilian Antarctic Program (PROANTAR)","European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme(Horizon 2020); Center for Information Technology of the University of Groningen; Brazilian Antarctic Program (PROANTAR)","We would like to thank the Center for Information Technology of the University of Groningen for their support and access to the University of Groningen High-Performance Computing cluster.

However, analyzing data from large numbers of loci associated with a small number of finite chromosomes introduces a challenge: loci on the same chromosome do not assort independently, leading to pseudoreplication. Previous studies have demonstrated that pseudoreplication can substantially reduce precision of genetic analyses (and make confidence intervals wider), such as FST and linkage disequilibrium (LD) measures between pairs of loci. In LD analyses, another type of dependency (overlapping pairs of the same loci) also creates pseudoreplication. Building on previous work, we explore the potential of entropy metrics to improve the status quo, particularly total correlation (TC), to assess pseudoreplication in LD studies. Our simulations, performed on a monoecious population with a range of effective population sizes (Ne) and numbers of loci, attempted to isolate the overlapping-pairs-of-loci effect by considering unlinked loci and using entropy to quantify inter-locus relationships. We hypothesized a positive correlation between TC and the number of loci (L), and a negative correlation between TC and Ne. Results from our statistical models predicting TC demonstrate a strong effect of the number of loci, and muted effects of Ne and other predictors, adding support to the use of entropy-based metrics as a tool for estimating the statistical information of complex genetic datasets. Our results also highlight a challenge regarding scalability; computational limitations arise as the number of loci grows, making our current approach limited to smaller datasets. Despite these challenges, this work further refines our understanding of entropy measures, and offers insights into the complex dynamics of genetic information in evolutionary ecology research.","[Ward, Eric J.] NOAA, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Northwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, 2725 Montlake Blvd East, Seattle, WA 98112 USA; [Waples, Robin S.] Univ Washington, Sch Aquat & Fishery Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle","Ward, EJ (corresponding author), NOAA, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Northwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, 2725 Montlake Blvd East, Seattle, WA 98112 USA.","eric.ward@noaa.gov; robinw3@uw.edu","","","","","",NA,21,0,0,0,0,"MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","","1099-4300","","ENTROPY-SWITZ","Entropy","SEP",2024,26,"9",NA,"","","",NA,NA,"805","10.3390/e26090805","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/e26090805",NA,"",8,"Physics, Multidisciplinary","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Physics","H4I0L",39330138,"gold","","","2024-10-25","WOS:001323082400001","View Full Record in Web of Science",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Atlantic Slope populations of Mud Sunfish were evaluated to determine the population structure, assess genetic diversity, and to identify presence of evolutionary significant units (ESU) in order to develop fundamental understandings of its occurrence. Tissue samples were collected from across the Atlantic Slope for genomic comparison. Restriction site Associated DNA Sequencing (RAD-Seq) was performed on 95 individuals from 14 populations. Mantel test provided evidence of a correlation between genetic and geographical distances, suggesting a pattern of isolationby-distance. Differences among populations of Mud Sunfish largely occur along a north-south latitudinal gradient. Bayesian clustering of putatively outlier SNP loci, suggests that regional adaptive pressure is occurring. Despite a large geographic distance and significant differences between the majority of the populations of Mud Sunfish, Bayesian clustering analysis suggests that two unresolved clades are persisting within the Atlantic Slope Drainage: a northern clade of Mud Sunfish ranging from New Jersey to North Carolina and a southern clade ranging from South Carolina to Florida.

With extremely low levels of genetic diversity, limited options for mates, and variation in reproductive success across females, there is concern regarding the potential for genetic limitations of population growth from inbreeding depression. In this study, we quantified reproductive success of female North Atlantic right whales with a modified de-lifing approach using reproductive history information collected over decades of field observations. We used double-digest restriction site-associated sequencing to sequence approximately 2% of the genome of 105 female North Atlantic right whales and combined genomic inbreeding estimates with individual fecundity values to assess evidence of inbreeding depression. Inbreeding depression could not explain the variance in reproductive success of females, however we present evidence that inbreeding depression may be affecting the viability of inbred fetuses-potentially lowering the reproductive success of the species as a whole. Combined, these results allay some concerns that genetic factors are impacting species survival as genetic diversity is being retained through selection against inbred fetuses. While still far fewer calves are being born each year than expected, the small role of genetics underlying variance in female fecundity suggests that variance may be explained by external factors that can potentially be mitigated through protection measures designed to reduce serious injury and mortality from human activities.","[Crossman, Carla A.; Radvan, Sonya N.; Frasier, Timothy R.] St Marys Univ, Biol Dept, Halifax, NS B3H 3C3, Canada; [Hamilton, Philip K.] New England Aquarium, Anderson Cabot Ctr Ocean Life, Boston, MA USA; [Brown, Moira W.] Canadian Whale Inst, Welshpool, NB, Canada; [Conger, Lisa A.] NOAA Fisheries, Northeast Fisheries Sci Ctr, Woods Hole, MA USA; [George, R.

We present the first Delphinus sequencing data from Senegal, at the edge of where long- and short-beaked dolphins co-occur in the Atlantic, but only recovering stranded dolphins with long or indeterminate beak lengths. While we detected little genetic structure across most of the North Atlantic, fixation indices demonstrate that Senegalese dolphins are distinct. Geography did not reliably predict phylogeny, with few monophyletic localities, but we do infer a monophyletic group of long-beaked dolphins from California, Peru, and possibly China. However, neither Senegalese long-beaked dolphins nor long-beaked D. d. tropicalis are closely related to Pacific long-beaked dolphins, providing no support for a worldwide long-beaked clade (formerly D. capensis).

Many studies report the presence of potentially toxic Gambierdiscus species along the Atlantic coasts including G. australes , G. silvae and G. excentricus . Estimates of their toxicity, as determined by bio-assays, vary substantially, both between species and strains of the same species. Therefore, there is a need for additional knowledge on the metabolite production of Gambierdiscus species and their variation to better understand species differences. Using liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry, toxin and metabolomic profiles of five species of Gambierdiscus found in the Atlantic Ocean were reported. In addition, a molecular network was constructed aiming at annotating the metabolomes. Results demonstrated that G. excentricus could be discriminated from the other species based solely on the presence of MTX4 and sulfogambierones and that the variation in toxin content for a single strain could be up to a factor of two due to different culture conditions between laboratories. While untargeted analyses highlighted a higher variability at the metabolome level, signal correction was applied and supervised multivariate statistics performed on the untargeted data set permitted the selection of 567 features potentially useful as biomarkers for the distinction of G. excentricus , G. caribaeus , G. carolinianus , G. silvae and G. belizeanus . Further studies will be required to validate the use of these biomarkers in discriminating Gambierdiscus species. The study also provided an overview about 17 compound classes present in Gambierdiscus , however, significant improvements in annotation are still required to reach a more comprehensive knowledge of Gambierdiscus ' metabolome.","[Yon, Thomas; Reveillon, Damien; Sibat, Manoella; Hess, Philipp] Ifremer, PHYTOX, Lab METALG, F-44000 Nantes, France; [Holland, Chris] NOAA, Beaufort Lab, Natl Ctr Coastal Ocean Sci, Natl Ocean Serv, Beaufort, NC 28516 USA; [Litaker, R.

Three fishmeal-free, 60% SBM pelleted diets (named B12, Fol, and Met, respectively) were tested to evaluate the effects on growth performance and tissue metabolite profiles of supplementation of vitamin B12 (0.012 mg/kg), folate (10 mg/kg), methionine (1 g/kg) respectively, above basal supplementation levels. A fourth SBM-based diet (named B12/Fol/Met) was formulated with a combination of B12, folate, and methionine to attain the above-mentioned target concentrations. A fifth 60% SBM diet (named FWS) with methionine supplementation (1 g/kg above basal supplementation levels), enriched with taurine, lysine and threonine as well as minerals, was also tested. This diet contained formulation targets and additives which have allowed for replacing fishmeal with plant proteins in rainbow trout feeds. Control diets included a fishmeal-based diet (named FM), an unsupplemented basal 60% SBM diet (named SBM60), and a natural diet (named N) made up of equal parts of fish (cigar minnows), squid and shrimp as a positive reference for growth performance. Formulated feeds contained approximately 37% total crude protein, approximately 14% total crude lipid and were energetically balanced. Standard growth performance metrics were measured, and tissues (liver, muscle) were collected at week 12 to evaluate diet-induced metabolic changes using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based metabolomics. Our results show that the FWS diet outperformed all other SBM diets and the FM diet under all performance metrics (P < 0.05). FIGLU was not detected in fish fed the N diet but was detected in those fed the SBM diets and the FM diet. Fish fed the FWS diet and the Met diet showed lower hepatic levels of FIGLU compared with the other SBM-based diets (P < 0.05), suggesting that among the different supplementation regimes, methionine supplementation was associated with lower FIGLU levels. The FWS diet produced tissue metabolite profiles that were more similar to those of fish fed the N diet. Based on our results, the FWS diet constitutes a promising SBM-based alternative diet to fishmeal for red drum. (c) 2023 The Authors.

We considered hatchery production of steelhead, the migratory anadromous form of the salmonid species Oncorhynchus mykiss, and investigated how differences among genetic lineages and environmental variation impacted life history traits. We genotyped 23,670 steelhead returning to the four California Central Valley hatcheries over 9 years from 2011 to 2019, confidently assigning parentage to 13,576 individuals to determine age and date of spawning and rates of iteroparity and repeat spawning within each year. We found steelhead from different genetic lineages showed significant differences in adult life history traits despite inhabiting similar environments. Differences between coastal and Central Valley steelhead lineages contributed to significant differences in age at return, timing of spawning, and rates of iteroparity among programs. In addition, adaptive genomic variation associated with life history development in this species varied among hatchery programs and was associated with the age of steelhead spawners only in the coastal lineage population. Environmental variation likely contributed to variations in phenotypic patterns observed over time, as our study period spanned both a marine heatwave and a serious drought in California. Our results highlight evidence of a strong genetic component underlying known phenotypic differences in life history traits between two steelhead lineages.","[Goetz, Laura C.; Pearse, Devon E.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Santa Cruz, CA USA; [Goetz, Laura C.; Nuetzel, Hayley; Vendrami, David L.

Here we present a new de-novo genome assembly for the endangered Caribbean star coral, Orbicella faveolata, using PacBio circular consensus reads. Our genome assembly improved the contiguity (51 versus 1,933 contigs) and complete and single copy BUSCO orthologs (93.6% versus 85.3%, database metazoa_odb10), compared to the currently available reference genome generated using short-read methodologies. Our new de-novo assembled genome also showed comparable quality metrics to other coral long-read genomes. Telomeric repeat analysis identified putative chromosomes in our scaffolded assembly, with these repeats at either one, or both ends, of scaffolded contigs. We identified 32,172 protein coding genes in our assembly through use of long-read RNA sequencing (ISO-seq) of additional O. faveolata fragments exposed to a range of abiotic and biotic treatments, and publicly available short-read RNA-seq data. With anthropogenic influences heavily affecting O. faveolata, as well as its increasing incorporation into reef restoration activities, this updated genome resource can be used for population genomics and other 'omics analyses to aid in the conservation of this species.","[Young, Benjamin D.; Macknight, Nicholas J.; Rosales, Stephanie M.; Studivan, Michael S.] Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine Atmospher & Earth Sci, Cooperat Inst Marine & Atmospher Sci, Miami, FL 33146 USA; [Young, Benjamin D.; Macknight, Nicholas J.; Rosales, Stephanie M.; Studivan, Michael S.] NOAA, Atlantic Oceanog & Meteorol Lab, Miami, FL 33149 USA; [Williamson, Olivia M.; Kron, Nicholas S.; Rodriguez, Natalia Andrade; Isma, Lys M.; Traylor-Knowles, Nikki] Univ Miami, Dept Marine Biol & Ecol, Rosenstiel Sch Marine Atmospher & Earth Sci, Miami, FL USA; [Muller, Erinn M.; Sirotzke, Stephanie M.; Williams, Sara D.] Mote Marine Lab, Sarasota, FL USA","University of Miami; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Atlantic Oceanographic & Meteorological Laboratory (AOML); University of Miami; Mote Marine Laboratory & Aquarium","Young, BD (corresponding author), Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine Atmospher & Earth Sci, Cooperat Inst Marine & Atmospher Sci, Miami, FL 33146 USA.;Young, BD (corresponding author), NOAA, Atlantic Oceanog & Meteorol Lab, Miami, FL 33149 USA.","benjamindouglasyoung1993@gmail.com","","Young, Benjamin/0000-0002-5195-9399; Williamson, Olivia/0000-0002-1710-1671; Andrade Rodriguez, Natalia/0000-0003-2014-4581","Florida Department of Environmental Protection","Florida Department of Environmental Protection","The authors thank SECORE International and the Coral Ecology Unit at the Southeast Fisheries Science Center for field assistance during coral spawn collections in Key Largo (collections conducted under permit FKNMS-2018-163-A1).

A proof-of-concept study is presented using serum from patients with cirrhotic liver or hepatocellular carcinoma. The approach uses collagenase DPS for digestion of deglycosylated serum and liquid-chromatography-trapped ion mobility-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-TIMS-MS/MS) to enhance the detection of ECM proteins in serum. It requires no sample enrichment and minimizes the albumin average precursor intensity readout to less than 1.2%.

However, substantial evidence suggests that hatchery fish are subject to differential selection pressures compared to their wild counterparts. Domestication selection, or adaptation to the hatchery environment, poses a risk to wild populations if traits specific to success in the hatchery environment have a genetic component and there is subsequent introgression between hatchery and wild fish. Few studies have investigated domestication selection in hatcheries on a genomic level, and even fewer have done so in parallel across multiple hatchery-wild population pairs. In this study, we used low-coverage whole-genome sequencing to investigate signals of domestication selection in three separate hatchery populations of Chinook salmon, Oncorhynchus tshawytscha, after approximately seven generations of divergence from their corresponding wild progenitor populations. We sequenced 192 individuals from populations across Southeast Alaska and estimated genotype likelihoods at over six million loci. We discovered a total of 14 outlier peaks displaying high genetic differentiation (F-ST) between hatchery-wild pairs, although no peaks were shared across the three comparisons. Peaks were small (53 kb on average) and often displayed elevated absolute genetic divergence (D-xy) and linkage disequilibrium, suggesting some level of domestication selection has occurred. Our study provides evidence that domestication selection can lead to genetic differences between hatchery and wild populations in only a few generations. Additionally, our data suggest that population-specific adaptation to hatchery environments likely occurs through different genetic pathways, even for populations with similar standing genetic variation. These results highlight the need to collect paired genotype-phenotype data to understand how domestication may be affecting fitness and to identify potential management practices that may mitigate genetic risks despite multiple pathways of domestication.","[Howe, Natasha S.; Hale, Matthew C.] Texas Christian Univ, Dept Biol, Ft Worth, TX 76109 USA; [Waters, Charles D.; Schaal, Sara M.; Larson, Wesley A.] NOAA, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Alaska Fisheries Sci Ctr, Auke Bay Labs, 17109 Point Lena Loop Rd, Juneau, AK 99801 USA; [Shedd, Kyle R.] Alaska Dept Fish & Game, Div Commercial Fisheries, Gene Conservat Lab, Anchorage, AK USA","Texas Christian University; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Alaska Department of Fish & Game","Hale, MC (corresponding author), Texas Christian Univ, Dept Biol, Ft Worth, TX 76109 USA.;Larson, WA (corresponding author), NOAA, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Alaska Fisheries Sci Ctr, Auke Bay Labs, 17109 Point Lena Loop Rd, Juneau, AK 99801 USA.","m.c.hale@tcu.edu; wes.larson@noaa.gov","","Hale, Matthew/0000-0002-7391-2727; Howe, Natasha/0009-0008-9059-7977","SERC grant; Adkins fellowship from Texas Christian University","SERC grant; Adkins fellowship from Texas Christian University","We would like to thank the following individuals and organizations for their invaluable contributions to this project: Lorna Wilson and Nathan Frost for the wealth of historical information regarding the study hatcheries and wild populations, respectively.

Low-coverage whole-genome sequencing (WGS) is increasingly used for the study of evolution and ecology in both model and non-model organisms; however, effective application of low-coverage WGS data requires the implementation of probabilistic frameworks to account for the uncertainties in genotype likelihoods. 2. Here, we present a probabilistic framework for using genotype likelihoods for standard population assignment applications. Additionally, we derive the Fisher information for allele frequency from genotype likelihoods and use that to describe a novel metric, the effective sample size, which figures heavily in assignment accuracy. We make these developments available for application through WGSassign, an open-source software package that is computationally efficient for working with whole-genome data. 3. Using simulated and empirical data sets, we demonstrate the behaviour of our assignment method across a range of population structures, sample sizes and read depths. Through these results, we show that WGSassign can provide highly accurate assignment, even for samples with low average read depths (<0.01X) and among weakly differentiated populations. 4. Our simulation results highlight the importance of equalizing the effective sample sizes among source populations in order to achieve accurate population assignment with low-coverage WGS data. We further provide study design recommendations for population assignment studies and discuss the broad utility of effective sample size for studies using low-coverage WGS data.","[Desaix, Matthew G.; Rodriguez, Marina D.; Ruegg, Kristen C.; Anderson, Eric C.] Colorado State Univ, Dept Biol, Ft Collins, CO 80521 USA; [Anderson, Eric C.] NOAA, Fisheries Ecol Div, Southwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Santa Cruz, CA USA; [Anderson, Eric C.] Colorado State Univ, Dept Fisheries Wildlife & Conservat Biol, Ft Collins, CO USA","Colorado State University; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Colorado State University","Desaix, MG (corresponding author), Colorado State Univ, Dept Biol, Ft Collins, CO 80521 USA.","mgdesaix@gmail.com","DeSaix, Matthew/KAL-6703-2024","DeSaix, Matthew/0000-0002-5721-0311; Rodriguez, Marina/0000-0002-7802-8623; Anderson, Eric/0000-0003-1326-0840","National Science Foundation; Alaska Department of Fish and Game [23-011]; NSF CAREER award [008933-00002]; University of Colorado Boulder; University of Colorado Anschutz; [2201538]","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Alaska Department of Fish and Game; NSF CAREER award(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Office of the Director (OD)); University of Colorado Boulder; University of Colorado Anschutz;","This study was funded by a Cooperative Agreement with the Alaska Department of Fish and Game (23-011) and an NSF CAREER award (008933-00002) to Kristen Ruegg.

Among the bonefish species in the Indo-Pacific region, Albula glossodonta are known to have one of the widest geographic ranges, from the Red Sea to the Central Pacific, but it is unknown how dispersive A. glossodonta are between geographically isolated islands. Volunteer anglers collected A. glossodonta fin clips from the main Hawaiian Islands in the North Pacific, Anaa Atoll in the South Pacific, and intermediate Kiritimati Island (Line Islands) to assess the scale of dispersal and population structure within the Pacific Ocean. Population genomics was conducted based on 208 individuals and 7225 SNPs. Although adult A. glossodonta exhibit strong site fidelity, genomic results show no population differentiation between Oahu and Maui in Hawai'i. Bonefishes exhibit significant population structure between Anaa and Hawai'i (F-ST = 0.096), with intermediate Kiritimati comprising admixed fishes. A lengthy larval duration likely promotes connectivity between Pacific islands. Regional management regimes may be most appropriate for a species with this level of dispersal.","[Kamikawa, Keith; Bowen, Brian W.] Univ Hawaii, Hawaii Inst Marine Biol SOEST, Kaneohe, HI 96744 USA; [Kobayashi, Donald] NOAA Pacific Isl Fisheries Sci Ctr, Honolulu, HI 96818 USA; [Peyton, Kimberly] Anuenue Fisheries Res Ctr, Hawaii Div Aquat Resources, Honolulu, HI 96819 USA; [Wallace, Elizabeth] FWC Fish & Wildlife Res Inst, St Petersburg, FL 33701 USA","University of Hawaii System; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservation Commission","Kamikawa, K (corresponding author), Univ Hawaii, Hawaii Inst Marine Biol SOEST, Kaneohe, HI 96744 USA.","keitht.kamikawa@gmail.com; bbowen@hawaii.edu; donald.kobayashi@noaa.gov; peyton@hawaii.edu; elizabeth.wallace@myfwc.com","","Kamikawa, Keith/0000-0002-3454-356X","University of Hawai'i at Mamacr;noa","University of Hawai'i at Mamacr;noa","Many thanks to all of the anglers who donated fin clips for this project.

These filter-feeding shellfish feed on A. catenella and accumulate paralytic shellfish toxins, such as saxitoxin, in tissues, making them unsafe for human consumption. Algal toxins also have detrimental effects upon several physiological functions in mussels, but particularly on the activity of hemocytes - the mussel immune cells. The objective of this work was to determine the effects of experimental exposure to A. catenella upon hemocyte metabolism and activity in the blue mussel, Mytilus edulis. To do so, mussels were exposed to cultures of the toxic dinoflagellate A. catenella for 120 h. The resulting mussel saxitoxin load had measurable effects upon survival of hemocytes and induced a stress response measured as increased ROS production. The neutral lipid fraction of mussel hemocytes decreased two-fold, suggesting a differential use of lipids. Metabolomic 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis showed that A. catenella modified the energy metabolism of hemocytes as well as hemocyte osmolyte composition. The modified energy metabolism was reenforced by contrasting plasma metabolomes between control and exposed mussels, suggesting that the blue mussel may reduce feed assimilation when exposed to A. catenella.","[Beauclercq, Stephane; Arnold, Alexandre A.; Marcotte, Isabelle] Univ Quebec Montreal, Dept Chem, POB 8888, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada; [Grenier, Olivier; Genard, Bertrand; Tremblay, Rejean] Univ Quebec Rimouski, Inst Sci Mer Rimouski, Rimouski, PQ, Canada; [Warschawski, Dror E.] PSL Univ, Sorbonne Univ, Ecole Normale Super, Lab Biomol,LBM,CNRS,UMR 7203, Paris, France; [Wikfors, Gary H.] NOAA Fisheries, Northeast Fisheries Sci Ctr, Milford, CT USA; [Genard, Bertrand] Labs Iso BioKem Inc, 367 Rue Gratien Gelinas, Rimouski, PQ, Canada","University of Quebec; University of Quebec Montreal; University of Quebec; Universite du Quebec a Rimouski; Universite PSL; Ecole Normale Superieure (ENS); Arts et Metiers Institute of Technology; Sorbonne Universite; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Chemistry (INC); National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA","Marcotte, I (corresponding author), Univ Quebec Montreal, Dept Chem, POB 8888, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada.","marcotte.isabelle@uqam.ca","Tremblay, Rejean/A-4971-2013","WARSCHAWSKI, Dror/0000-0002-4363-4965; Beauclercq, Stephane/0000-0002-1029-559X","Environment and Climate Change Canada [FDE-CA-2017i002]; Natural Sciences and Engi-neering Research Council (NSERC) of Canada [RGPIN-2018-06200, 2014-RS-171172]","Environment and Climate Change Canada; Natural Sciences and Engi-neering Research Council (NSERC) of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC))","This project was supported by Environment and Climate Change Canada (FDE-CA-2017i002 to R.T.) , the Natural Sciences and Engi-neering Research Council (NSERC) of Canada (grant RGPIN-2018-06200 to I.M.) and the Ressources Aquatiques Quebec research network (Fonds de Recherche du Quebec - Nature et Technologies, no. 2014-RS-171172) .

While genetic markers have been widely applied to describe migratory connections, the rapid development of new sequencing methods, such as low-coverage whole genome sequencing (lcWGS), provides new opportunities for improved estimates of migratory connectivity. Here, we use lcWGS to identify fine-scale population structure in a widespread songbird, the American Redstart (Setophaga ruticilla), and accurately assign individuals to genetically distinct breeding populations. Assignment of individuals from the nonbreeding range reveals population-specific patterns of varying migratory connectivity. By combining migratory connectivity results with demographic analysis of population abundance and trends, we consider full annual cycle conservation strategies for preserving numbers of individuals and genetic diversity. Notably, we highlight the importance of the Northern Temperate-Greater Antilles migratory population as containing the largest proportion of individuals in the species. Finally, we highlight valuable considerations for other population assignment studies aimed at using lcWGS. Our results have broad implications for improving our understanding of the ecology and evolution of migratory species through conservation genomics approaches.","[DeSaix, Matthew G.; Anderson, Eric C.; Bossu, Christen M.; Rayne, Christine E.; Ruegg, Kristen C.] Colorado State Univ, Dept Biol, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Anderson, Eric C.] NOAA, Southwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Fisheries Ecol Div, Santa Cruz, CA USA; [Anderson, Eric C.; Schweizer, Teia M.] Colorado State Univ, Dept Fisheries Wildlife & Conservat Biol, Ft Collins, CO USA; [Bayly, Nicholas J.] SELVA Invest Conservac Neotrop, DG42A 20-37, Bogota, Colombia; [Narang, Darshan S.] Trinidad & Tobago Field Naturalists Club, Port Of Spain, Trinidad Tobago; [Hagelin, Julie C.] Alaska Dept Fish & Game, Threatened Endangered & Divers Program, Fairbanks, AK USA; [Gibbs, H.

The mechanisms that create and maintain these islands and how they contribute to adaptive divergence is an active research topic. Here, we use sockeye salmon as a model to investigate both the mechanisms responsible for creating islands of divergence and the patterns of differentiation at these islands. Previous research suggested that multiple islands contributed to adaptive radiation of sockeye salmon. However, the low-density genomic methods used by these studies made it difficult to fully elucidate the mechanisms responsible for islands and connect genotypes to adaptive variation. We used whole genome resequencing to genotype millions of loci to investigate patterns of genetic variation at islands and the mechanisms that potentially created them. We discovered 64 islands, including 16 clustered in four genomic regions shared between two isolated populations. Characterisation of these four regions suggested that three were likely created by structural variation, while one was created by processes not involving structural variation. All four regions were small (< 600 kb), suggesting low recombination regions do not have to span megabases to be important for adaptive divergence. Differentiation at islands was not consistently associated with established population attributes. In sum, the landscape of adaptive divergence and the mechanisms that create it are complex; this complexity likely helps to facilitate fine-scale local adaptation unique to each population.","[Euclide, Peter T.] Purdue Univ, Dept Forestry & Nat Resources, Illinois Indiana Sea Grant, W Lafayette, IN 47906 USA; [Larson, Wesley A.] NOAA, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Alaska Fisheries Sci Ctr, Auke Bay Labs, 17109 Point Lena Loop Rd, Juneau, AK 99801 USA; [Shi, Yue] Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Coll Fisheries & Ocean Sci, Juneau, AK USA; [Gruenthal, Kristen] Alaska Dept Fish & Game, Juneau, AK USA; [Gruenthal, Kristen] Univ Wisconsin Stevens Point, Coll Nat Resources, Wisconsin Dept Nat Resources, Wisconsin Cooperat Fishery Res Unit,Off Appl Sci, Stevens Point, WI USA; [Christensen, Kris A.] Univ Victoria, Dept Biol, Victoria, BC, Canada; [Seeb, Jim; Seeb, Lisa] Univ Washington, Sch Aquat & Fishery Sci, Seattle, WA USA; [Euclide, Peter T.] Purdue Univ, Dept Forestry & Nat Resources, 195 Marsteller St, W Lafayette, IN 47906 USA","Purdue University System; Purdue University; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of Alaska System; University of Alaska Fairbanks; Alaska Department of Fish & Game; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Stevens Point; University of Victoria; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; Purdue University System; Purdue University","Larson, WA (corresponding author), NOAA, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Alaska Fisheries Sci Ctr, Auke Bay Labs, 17109 Point Lena Loop Rd, Juneau, AK 99801 USA.;Euclide, PT (corresponding author), Purdue Univ, Dept Forestry & Nat Resources, 195 Marsteller St, W Lafayette, IN 47906 USA.","peuclide@purdue.edu; wes.larson@noaa.gov","Seeb, Lisa/GSN-3076-2022; Shi, Yue/AAD-7368-2021","Christensen, Kristen/0000-0003-0021-0326; Shi, Yue/0000-0002-2860-2666; Euclide, Peter/0000-0002-1212-0435; Seeb, Lisa/0000-0002-0626-9743; Larson, Wesley/0000-0003-4473-3401","We thank the Alaska Salmon Program at the University of Washington, especially Chris Boatright, Jackie Carter, and Daniel Schindler for assisting with sample collection and providing valuable local knowledge.

Illegal fishing and the potential impact on wild populations because of the stock enhancement programs would benefit from a genomic tool to discriminate among populations and provide traceability. In this study, SNP panels for green abalone were developed from ddRad-seq data and used to evaluate individual assignment accuracy at two hierarchical scales. One included three genetic groups: 1) Guadalupe Island (GI), 2) Northern Coastal Group (NCG) and 3) Southern Coastal Group (SCG); and the second only the two coastal groups. Eight SNP panels (from 50 to 1000 loci), with markers ranked by FST, were evaluated to assess the power to identify individuals from the three genetic groups at both scales. The predictive model found high discriminatory power for almost all the SNP datasets for two of the three groups (GI and SCG), ranging from 0.72 (s.d. = 0.32) to 1. At the coastal scale, assignment accuracies for NCG individuals varied substantially with the number of SNP markers, ranging from 0.01 (s.d. = 0.05) with the 50 most informative SNPs to 0.79 (s.d. = 0.30) using 1000 SNPs. These SNP panels will provide genetic tools for tracing the origin of green abalone in the food-supply chain, which will assist fishing cooperatives in certifying their products and tackling illegal fishing in Me & PRIME;xico.","[Paulina, Mejia-Ruiz; Ricardo, Perez-Enriquez; Alberto, Mares-Mayagoitia Jorge; Fausto, Valenzuela-Quinonez] Ctr Invest Biol Noroeste SC, Av Inst Politecn Nacl 195, Playa Palo De Santa Rita, Mexico; [Andrew, Severin] Iowa State Univ, Off Biotechnol, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Octavio, Martinez-Rincon Raul] CONACYT Ctr Invest Biol Noroeste SC, Av Inst Politecn Nacl 195, Playa Palo De Santa Rita, Mexico; [Carlos, Garza John] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Ocean Sci, 110 McAllister Way, Santa Cruz, CA 95060 USA; [Carlos, Garza John] NOAA, Southwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, 110 McAllister Way, Santa Cruz, CA 95060 USA","Iowa State University; University of California System; University of California Santa Cruz; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA","Fausto, VQ (corresponding author), Ctr Invest Biol Noroeste SC, Av Inst Politecn Nacl 195, Playa Palo De Santa Rita, Mexico.","fvalenzuela@cibnor.mx","Perez-Enriquez, Ricardo/IQT-5339-2023","","Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia grant [PDCPN20151-1743]","Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia grant","This research was supported by Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia grant (PDCPN20151-1743) Un nuevo enfoque para la recuperacion, inspeccion y vigilancia de recursos sobreexplotados de alto valor comercial, caso de estudio: La pesqueria de abulon.

Whaling catch records indicate the importance of the Southern Ocean for this species; approximately 730,000 fin whales were harvested during the 20th century in the Southern Hemisphere (SH) alone, 94% of which were at high latitudes. Genetic samples from contemporary whales can provide a window to past population size changes, but the challenges of sampling in remote Antarctic waters limit the availability of data. Here, we take advantage of historical samples in the form of bones and baleen available from ex-whaling stations and museums to assess the pre-whaling diversity of this once abundant species. We sequenced 27 historical mitogenomes and 50 historical mitochondrial control region sequences of fin whales to gain insight into the population structure and genetic diversity of Southern Hemisphere fin whales (SHFWs) before and after the whaling. Our data, both independently and when combined with mitogenomes from the literature, suggest SHFWs are highly diverse and may represent a single panmictic population that is genetically differentiated from Northern Hemisphere populations. These are the first historic mitogenomes available for SHFWs, providing a unique time series of genetic data for this species.","[Buss, Danielle L.; Goodall-Copestake, William P.; Jackson, Jennifer A.] British Antarctic Survey, Natl Environm Res Council, Cambridge CB3 0ET, England; [Buss, Danielle L.; Atmore, Lane M.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Archaeol, Downing St, Cambridge CB2 3DZ, England; [Atmore, Lane M.] Univ Oslo, Ctr Ecol & Evolutionary Synth, Dept Biosci, N-0316 Oslo, Norway; [Zicos, Maria H.; Brace, Selina; Barnes, Ian; Sabin, Richard] Nat Hist Museum, Cromwell Rd, London SW7, England; [Goodall-Copestake, William P.] Scottish Assoc Marine Sci, Oban PA37 1QA, England; [Archer, Frederick I.] Southwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Ocean & Atmospher Adm, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Baker, C.

In animals, its role in generating novel and independent lineages (hybrid speciation) has been strongly debated, with only a few cases supported by genomic data. The South American fur seal (SAfs) Arctocephalus australis is a marine apex predator of Pacific and Atlantic waters, with a disjunct set of populations in Peru and Northern Chile [Pe-ruvian fur seal (Pfs)] with controversial taxonomic status. We demonstrate, using complete genome and reduced representation sequencing, that the Pfs is a genetically distinct species with an admixed genome that originated from hybridization between the SAfs and the Galapagos fur seal (Arctocephalus galapagoensis) similar to 400,000 years ago. Our results strongly support the origin of Pfs by homoploid hybrid speciation over alternative introgression scenarios.

Conservation efforts often address extrinsic threats, such as environmental degradation and overexploitation, that can limit the recovery of endangered populations. Genetic factors such as inbreeding depression can also affect population dynamics but these effects are rarely measured in the wild and thus often neglected in conservation efforts. Here we show that inbreeding depression strongly influences the population dynamics of an endangered killer whale population, despite genomic signatures of purging of deleterious alleles via natural selection. We find that the 'Southern Residents', which are currently endangered despite nearly 50 years of conservation efforts, exhibit strong inbreeding depression for survival. Our population models suggest that this inbreeding depression limits population growth and predict further decline if the population remains genetically isolated and typical environmental conditions continue. The Southern Residents also had more inferred homozygous deleterious alleles than three other, growing, populations, further suggesting that inbreeding depression affects population fitness. These results demonstrate that inbreeding depression can substantially limit the recovery of endangered populations. Conservation actions focused only on extrinsic threats may therefore fail to account for key intrinsic genetic factors that also limit population growth.

Small but significant genetic differentiation was observed between the northern and southern contingents (FST = 0.0010). Genetic assignments to reference samples from the two contingents were performed with predictive accuracy > 85%. Fish from both contingents were present along the U.S. shelf during late winter and early spring but also, without prior evidence of this, likely in Canadian waters from late spring to fall.

Nevertheless, estimates of N-e in organisms with complex life-history traits remain scarce because of the challenges associated with estimation methods. Partially clonal plants capable of both vegetative (clonal) growth and sexual reproduction are a common group of organisms for which the discrepancy between the apparent number of individuals (ramets) and the number of genetic individuals (genets) can be striking, and it is unclear how this discrepancy relates to N-e. In this study, we analysed two populations of the orchid Cypripedium calceolus to understand how the rate of clonal versus sexual reproduction affected N-e. We genotyped > 1000 ramets at microsatellite and SNP loci, and estimated contemporary N-e with the linkage disequilibrium method, starting from the theoretical expectation that variance in reproductive success among individuals caused by clonal reproduction and by constraints on sexual reproduction would lower N-e. We considered factors potentially affecting our estimates, including different marker types and sampling strategies, and the influence of pseudoreplication in genomic data sets on N-e confidence intervals. The magnitude of N-e/N-ramets and N-e/N-genets ratios we provide may be used as reference points for other species with similar life-history traits. Our findings demonstrate that N-e in partially clonal plants cannot be predicted based on the number of genets generated by sexual reproduction, because demographic changes over time can strongly influence N-e. This is especially relevant in species of conservation concern in which population declines may not be detected by only ascertaining the number of genets.","[Gargiulo, Roberta; Viruel, Juan; Fay, Michael F.] Royal Bot Gardens, Richmond TW9 3DS, England; [Waples, Robin S.] Northwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, NOAA Fisheries, Seattle, WA USA; [Waples, Robin S.] Univ Washington, Seattle, WA USA; [Grow, Adri K.] Smith Coll, Dept Biol Sci, Northampton, MA USA; [Shefferson, Richard P.] Univ Tokyo, Org Programs Environm Sci, Tokyo, Japan; [Fay, Michael F.] Univ Western Australia, Sch Biol Sci, Crawley, WA, Australia; [Kull, Tiiu] Estonian Univ Life Sci, Tartu, Estonia","Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; Smith College; University of Tokyo; University of Western Australia; Estonian University of Life Sciences","Gargiulo, R (corresponding author), Royal Bot Gardens, Richmond TW9 3DS, England.","r.gargiulo@kew.org","Gargiulo, Roberta/AAP-8538-2020; Shefferson, Richard/M-7115-2015; Waples, Robin/K-1126-2016; Fay, Michael/AAU-5861-2021; Fay, Michael F/G-4741-2010; Kull, Tiiu/C-5771-2017; Viruel Sanchez, Juan/H-4227-2015","Fay, Michael F/0000-0003-3491-9093; Grow, Adri/0000-0003-1262-8412; Gargiulo, Roberta/0000-0001-8663-6568; Kull, Tiiu/0000-0003-2841-7361; Viruel Sanchez, Juan/0000-0001-5658-8411","British Ecological Society [SR18/1418]","British Ecological Society","British Ecological Society, Grant/Award Number: SR18/1418",NA,147,2,2,4,28,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","1752-4571","","","EVOL APPL","Evol.

However, cryptic species have been demonstrated in many cephalopods. Therefore, even if the sequenced specimen is very similar morphologically to the species in question, the likelihood that it is a member of the species in question decreases with increasing distance from the type locality. An associated problem is that many publications do not provide information adequate to determine the source locality for the genomic sequence. We reviewed a decade of literature on mitochondrial genomes of cephalopods and found a total of 43 publications containing 48 species within 23 genera. Of the 48 species, only 17 could be evaluated for our geographic question. Distances between sampling locality and type locality of the named species ranged from 0 nautical miles (sampled at type locality) to half-way around the world.

These collaborations help to protect populations whose distributions span political borders. One common limitation to multijurisdictional collaboration is consistency in data recording and reporting. This limitation can impact genetic research, which relies on data about specific markers in an organism's genome. Incomplete overlap of markers between separate studies can prevent direct comparisons of results. Standardized marker panels can reduce the impact of this issue and provide a common starting place for new research. Genotyping-in-thousands (GTSeq) is one approach used to create standardized marker panels for nonmodel organisms. Here, we describe the development, optimization, and early assessments of a new GTSeq panel for use with walleye (Sander vitreus) from the Great Lakes region of North America. High genome-coverage sequencing conducted using RAD capture provided genotypes for thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). From these markers, SNP and microhaplotype markers were chosen, which were informative for genetic stock identification (GSI) and kinship analysis. The final GTSeq panel contained 500 markers, including 197 microhaplotypes and 303 SNPs. Leave-one-out GSI simulations indicated that GSI accuracy should be greater than 80% in most jurisdictions. The false-positive rates of parent-offspring and full-sibling kinship identification were found to be low. Finally, genotypes could be consistently scored among separate sequencing runs >94% of the time. Results indicate that the GTSeq panel that we developed should perform well for multijurisdictional walleye research throughout the Great Lakes region.","[Euclide, Peter T.] Purdue Univ, Dept Forestry & Nat Resources, W Lafayette, IN USA; [Larson, Wesley A.; Bootsma, Matthew] Univ Wisconsin Stevens Point, Coll Nat Resources, Stevens Point, WI USA; [Larson, Wesley A.] NOAA, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Alaska Fisheries Sci Ctr, Juneau, AK USA; [Miller, Loren M.] Minnesota Dept Nat Resources, St Paul, MN USA; [Scribner, Kim T.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Fish & Wildlife, Dept Integrat Biol, E Lansing, MI USA; [Stott, Wendylee] Fisheries & Oceans Canada, Art & Aquat Res Div, Winnipeg, MB, Canada; [Wilson, Chris C.] Trent Univ, Ontario Minist Nat Resources & Forestry, Peterborough, ON, Canada; [Latch, Emily K.] Univ Wisconsin Milwaukee, Dept Biol Sci, Milwaukee, WI USA; [Euclide, Peter T.] Purdue Univ, Dept Forestry & Nat Resources, 195 Marsteller St, W Lafayette, IN 47906 USA","Purdue University System; Purdue University; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Stevens Point; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Minnesota Department of Natural Resources; Michigan State University; Fisheries & Oceans Canada; Trent University; Ministry of Natural Resources & Forestry; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Milwaukee; Purdue University System; Purdue University","Euclide, PT (corresponding author), Purdue Univ, Dept Forestry & Nat Resources, 195 Marsteller St, W Lafayette, IN 47906 USA.","peuclide@purdue.edu","; Wilson, Chris/J-4851-2012","Latch, Emily/0000-0002-9892-1056; Miller, Loren/0000-0002-5482-2152; Euclide, Peter/0000-0002-1212-0435; Wilson, Chris/0000-0002-9528-0652; Larson, Wesley/0000-0003-4473-3401; Bootsma, Matthew/0000-0003-0879-5066","Great Lakes Fishery Commission [2019_LAR_440830]","Great Lakes Fishery Commission","Great Lakes Fishery Commission, Grant/Award Number: 2019_LAR_440830",NA,75,5,5,2,8,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","2045-7758","","","ECOL EVOL","Ecol.

Past genetic research using 11 microsatellite loci identified six genetic stocks of lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) within Lake Michigan, USA. However, ambiguity in genetic stock assignments suggested those neutral microsatellite markers did not provide adequate power for delineating lake whitefish stocks in this system, prompting calls for a genomics approach to investigate stock structure. Here, we generated a dense genomic dataset to characterize population structure and investigate patterns of neutral and adaptive genetic diversity among lake whitefish populations in Lake Michigan. Using Rapture sequencing, we genotyped 829 individuals collected from 17 baseline populations at 197,588 SNP markers after quality filtering. Although the overall pattern of genetic structure was similar to the previous microsatellite study, our genomic data provided several novel insights. Our results indicated a large genetic break between the northwestern and eastern sides of Lake Michigan, and we found a much greater level of population structure on the eastern side compared to the northwestern side. Collectively, we observed five genomic islands of adaptive divergence on five different chromosomes. Each island displayed a different pattern of population structure, suggesting that combinations of genotypes at these adaptive regions are facilitating local adaptation to spatially heterogenous selection pressures. Additionally, we identified a large linkage disequilibrium block of similar to 8.5 Mb on chromosome 20 that is suggestive of a putative inversion but with a low frequency of the minor haplotype. Our study provides a comprehensive assessment of population structure and adaptive variation that can help inform the management of Lake Michigan's lake whitefish fishery and highlights the utility of incorporating adaptive loci into fisheries management.","[Shi, Yue; McPhee, Megan, V] Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Coll Fisheries & Ocean Sci, Juneau, AK 99775 USA; [Shi, Yue; Euclide, Peter T.] Univ Wisconsin, Coll Nat Resources, Wisconsin Cooperat Fishery Res Unit, Stevens Point, WI 54481 USA; [Homola, Jared J.; Isermann, Daniel A.; Larson, Wesley A.] Univ Wisconsin, US Geol Survey, Wisconsin Cooperat Fishery Res Unit, Coll Nat Resources, Stevens Point, WI 54481 USA; [Caroffino, David C.] Charlevoix Res Stn, Michigan Dept Nat Resources, Charlevoix, MI USA; [Larson, Wesley A.] NOAA, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Alaska Fisheries Sci Ctr, Auke Bay Labs, Juneau, AK USA","University of Alaska System; University of Alaska Fairbanks; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Stevens Point; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Stevens Point; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA","Shi, Y (corresponding author), Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Coll Fisheries & Ocean Sci, Juneau, AK 99775 USA.","yshi8@alaska.edu","Shi, Yue/AAD-7368-2021","Shi, Yue/0000-0002-2860-2666","Great Lakes Fishery Trust [2018.1791]","Great Lakes Fishery Trust","Great Lakes Fishery Trust, Grant/Award Number: 2018.1791",NA,88,1,1,1,14,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","1752-4571","","","EVOL APPL","Evol.

Decades of excess mortality from gillnet fishing have driven Mexico's vaquita porpoise (Phocoena sinus) to similar to 10 remaining individuals. We analyzed whole-genome sequences from 20 vaquitas and integrated genomic and demographic information into stochastic, individual-based simulations to quantify the species' recovery potential. Our analysis suggests that the vaquita's historical rarity has resulted in a low burden of segregating deleterious variation, reducing the risk of inbreeding depression. Similarly, genome-informed simulations suggest that the vaquita can recover if bycatch mortality is immediately halted. This study provides hope for vaquitas and other naturally rare endangered species and highlights the utility of genomics in predicting extinction risk.","[Robinson, Jacqueline A.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Inst Human Genet, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Kyriazis, Christopher C.; Wayne, Robert K.; Lohmueller, Kirk E.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Nigenda-Morales, Sergio F.] Ctr Res & Adv Studies Cinvestav, Adv Genom Unit, Natl Lab Genom Biodivers Langebio, Guanajuato, Mexico; [Beichman, Annabel C.] Univ Washington, Dept Genome Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Rojas-Bracho, Lorenzo] Comis Nacl Areas Nat Protegidas SEMARNAT, Ensenada, Baja California, Mexico; [Rojas-Bracho, Lorenzo] PNUD Sinergia Comis Nacl Areas Nat Protegidas, Ensenada, Baja California, Mexico; [Robertson, Kelly M.; Taylor, Barbara L.; Morin, Phillip A.] NOAA, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Southwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Fontaine, Michael C.] Univ Montpellier, CNRS, MIVEGEC, IRD, Montpellier, France; [Fontaine, Michael C.] Ctr Rech Ecol & Evolut Sante CREES, Montpellier, France; [Fontaine, Michael C.] Univ Groningen, Groningen Inst Evolutionary Life Sci GELIFES, Groningen, Netherlands; [Lohmueller, Kirk E.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, David Geffen Sch Med, Dept Human Genet, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA","University of California System; University of California San Francisco; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Universite de Montpellier; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Montpellier; University of Groningen; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; University of California Los Angeles Medical Center; David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA","Robinson, JA (corresponding author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Inst Human Genet, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA.;Kyriazis, CC; Lohmueller, KE (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.;Rojas-Bracho, L (corresponding author), Comis Nacl Areas Nat Protegidas SEMARNAT, Ensenada, Baja California, Mexico.;Rojas-Bracho, L (corresponding author), PNUD Sinergia Comis Nacl Areas Nat Protegidas, Ensenada, Baja California, Mexico.;Taylor, BL; Morin, PA (corresponding author), NOAA, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Southwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.;Lohmueller, KE (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, David Geffen Sch Med, Dept Human Genet, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.","jacquelne.robinson@ucsf.edu; ckyriazis@g.ucla.edu; lrojasbracho@gmail.com; klohmueller@g.ucla.edu; barbara.taylor@noaa.gov; phillip.morin@noaa.gov","Robinson, Jacqueline/H-8383-2019; Fontaine, Michael/G-5350-2011","Robinson, Jacqueline/0000-0002-5556-815X; Wayne, Robert/0000-0003-3537-2245; Taylor, Barbara/0000-0001-7620-0736; Nigenda-Morales, Sergio/0000-0002-2301-6975; Beichman, Annabel/0000-0002-6991-587X; Fontaine, Michael/0000-0003-1156-4154","National Institutes of Health (NIH) [R35GM119856]; Biological Mechanisms of Healthy Aging Training Program, NIH [T32AG066574]; Mexican National Council for Science and Technology (CONACYT) [724094]; Mexican Secretariat of Agriculture and Rural Development postdoctoral fellowship","National Institutes of Health (NIH)(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); Biological Mechanisms of Healthy Aging Training Program, NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USAOffice of the Administrator (NIH)); Mexican National Council for Science and Technology (CONACYT)(Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT)); Mexican Secretariat of Agriculture and Rural Development postdoctoral fellowship","We thank F.

Understanding how biodiversity sustains ecosystems under anthropogenic stressors and global environmental change will require new ways of deriving and applying biodiversity data. A major challenge is that biodiversity data and knowledge are scattered, biased, collected with numerous methods, and stored in inconsistent ways. The Group on Earth Observations Biodiversity Observation Network (GEO BON) has developed the Essential Biodiversity Variables (EBVs) as fundamental metrics to help aggregate, harmonize, and interpret biodiversity observation data from diverse sources. Mapping and analyzing EBVs can help to evaluate how aspects of biodiversity are distributed geographically and how they change over time. EBVs are also intended to serve as inputs and validation to forecast the status and trends of biodiversity, and to support policy and decision making. Here, we assess the feasibility of implementing Genetic Composition EBVs (Genetic EBVs), which are metrics of within-species genetic variation. We review and bring together numerous areas of the field of genetics and evaluate how each contributes to global and regional genetic biodiversity monitoring with respect to theory, sampling logistics, metadata, archiving, data aggregation, modeling, and technological advances. We propose four Genetic EBVs: (i) Genetic Diversity; (ii) Genetic Differentiation; (iii) Inbreeding; and (iv) Effective Population Size (N-e). We rank Genetic EBVs according to their relevance, sensitivity to change, generalizability, scalability, feasibility and data availability. We outline the workflow for generating genetic data underlying the Genetic EBVs, and review advances and needs in archiving genetic composition data and metadata. We discuss how Genetic EBVs can be operationalized by visualizing EBVs in space and time across species and by forecasting Genetic EBVs beyond current observations using various modeling approaches. Our review then explores challenges of aggregation, standardization, and costs of operationalizing the Genetic EBVs, as well as future directions and opportunities to maximize their uptake globally in research and policy. The collection, annotation, and availability of genetic data has made major advances in the past decade, each of which contributes to the practical and standardized framework for large-scale genetic observation reporting. Rapid advances in DNA sequencing technology present new opportunities, but also challenges for operationalizing Genetic EBVs for biodiversity monitoring regionally and globally. With these advances, genetic composition monitoring is starting to be integrated into global conservation policy, which can help support the foundation of all biodiversity and species' long-term persistence in the face of environmental change. We conclude with a summary of concrete steps for researchers and policy makers for advancing operationalization of Genetic EBVs. The technical and analytical foundations of Genetic EBVs are well developed, and conservation practitioners should anticipate their increasing application as efforts emerge to scale up genetic biodiversity monitoring regionally and globally.","[Hoban, Sean] Morton Arboretum, Ctr Tree Sci, 4100 Illinois Rt 53, Lisle, IL 60532 USA; [Archer, Frederick, I] NOAA NMFS, Southwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, 8901 La Jolla Shores Dr, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Bertola, Laura D.] CUNY City Coll, 160 Convent Ave, New York, NY 10031 USA; [Bragg, Jason G.] Royal Bot Garden Sydney, Australian Inst Bot Sci, Res Ctr Ecogstern Resilience, Mrs Macquaries Rd, Sydney, NSW 2000, Australia; [Breed, Martin F.] Flinders Univ S Australia, Coll Sci & Engn, Univ Dr, Bedford Pk, SA 5042, Australia; [Bruford, Michael W.] Cardiff Univ, Sch Biosci, Cathays Pk, Cardiff CF10 3AX, S Glam, Wales; [Coleman, Melinda A.] New South Wales Fisheries, Dept Primary Ind, Natl Marine Sci Ctr, 2 Bay Dr, Coffs Harbour, NSW 2450, Australia; [Ekblom, Robert] Swedish Environm Protect Agcy, Wildlife Anal Unit, Blekholmsterrassen 36, SE-10648 Stockholm, Sweden; [Funk, W.

Experimental diets included fish (F), shrimp (SH), squid (SQ), fish and shrimp (FSH), fish and squid (FSQ), shrimp and squid (SHSQ), fish, shrimp, and squid (FSHSQ). A commercial fishmeal-based pelleted diet was used as a control. Fish were fed isocalorically. Red drum liver samples were collected at five different time points: TO, before the start of the trial (n = 12), and subsequently every 3 weeks over the course of 12 weeks (T3, T6, T9, T12), with n = 9 fish/diet/time point. Polar liver extracts were analyzed by NMR-based metabolomics. Multivariate statistical analyses (PCA, PLS-DA) revealed that red drum fed the F diet had a distinct liver metabolite profile from fish fed the other diets, with those fed SH, SQ and the combination diets displaying greater similarities in their metabolome. Results show that 19 metabolites changed significantly among the different dietary treatments, including amino acids and amino acid derivatives, quaternary amines and methylamines, carbohydrates and phospholipids. Specifically, gamma-butyrobetaine, N-formimino-L-glutamate (FIGLU), sarcosine and betaalanine were among the most discriminating metabolites. Significant correlations were found between metabolites and six growth performance parameters (final body weight, total length, condition factor, liver weight, hepatosomatic index, and eviscerated weight). Metabolites identified in this study constitute potential candidates for supplementation in fish feeds for aquaculture and optimization of existing formulations. Additionally, we identified a quaternary amine, gamma-butyrobetaine as a potential biomarker of shrimp consumption in red drum. These results warrant further investigation and biomarker validation and have the potential for broader applicability outside of the aquaculture field in future investigations in wild red drum populations and potentially other carnivorous marine fishes.","[Casu, Fabio; Klett, David; Yost, Justin; Watson, Aaron M.] Marine Resources Res Inst, South Carolina Dept Nat Resources, 217 Ft Johnson Rd, Charleston, SC 29412 USA; [Denson, Michael R.] NOAA, Hollings Marine Lab, 331 Ft Johnson Rd, Charleston, SC 29412 USA","National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA","Casu, F; Watson, AM (corresponding author), Marine Resources Res Inst, South Carolina Dept Nat Resources, 217 Ft Johnson Rd, Charleston, SC 29412 USA.","casuf@dnr.sc.goV; klettd@dnr.sc.gov; yostj@dnr.sc.gov; mike.denson@noaa.gov; watsona@dnr.sc.gov","Casu, Fabio/AHD-0531-2022; Watson, Aaron/H-8752-2019","Watson, Aaron/0000-0001-5180-7750; Casu, Fabio/0000-0003-2378-375X; Klett, David/0000-0002-5181-1984","Slocum Lunz Foundation; Saltwater Recreational Fisheries Advisory Committee (SRFAC)","Slocum Lunz Foundation; Saltwater Recreational Fisheries Advisory Committee (SRFAC)","This work was funded in part by a Slocum Lunz Foundation Grant to D.

A popular theme in recent studies is the search for large-effect loci that explain substantial portions of phenotypic variance for a key trait(s). If such loci can be linked to adaptations, 2 important questions arise: 1) Should information from these loci be used to reconfigure conservation units (CUs), even if this conflicts with overall patterns of genetic differentiation? 2) How should this information be used in viability assessments of populations and larger CUs? In this review, we address these questions in the context of recent studies of Chinook salmon and steelhead (anadromous form of rainbow trout) that show strong associations between adult migration timing and specific alleles in one small genomic region. Based on the polygenic paradigm (most traits are controlled by many genes of small effect) and genetic data available at the time showing that early-migrating populations are most closely related to nearby late-migrating populations, adult migration differences in Pacific salmon and steelhead were considered to reflect diversity within CUs rather than separate CUs. Recent data, however, suggest that specific alleles are required for early migration, and that these alleles are lost in populations where conditions do not support early-migrating phenotypes. Contrasting determinations under the US Endangered Species Act and the State of California's equivalent legislation illustrate the complexities of incorporating genomics data into CU configuration decisions. Regardless how CUs are defined, viability assessments should consider that 1) early-migrating phenotypes experience disproportionate risks across large geographic areas, so it becomes important to identify early-migrating populations that can serve as reliable sources for these valuable genetic resources; and 2) genetic architecture, especially the existence of large-effect loci, can affect evolutionary potential and adaptability.","[Waples, Robin S.; Ford, Michael J.; Nichols, Krista; Kardos, Marty; Myers, Jim; McKinney, Garrett; Pess, George R.] Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Northwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, 2725 Montlake Blvd East, Seattle, WA 98112 USA; [Kardos, Marty] Univ Montana, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Thompson, Tasha Q.] Michigan State Univ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Anderson, Eric C.; Pearse, Devon E.] Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Southwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Santa Cruz, CA USA; [Koch, Ilana J.; Narum, Shawn R.; Willis, Stuart C.] Columbia River Intertribal Fish Commiss, Hagerman, ID USA; [McKinney, Garrett; Seamons, Todd R.; Warheit, Kenneth, I] Washington Dept Fish & Wildlife, Olympia, WA USA; [Miller, Michael R.] Univ Calif Davis, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Naish, Kerry; Quinn, Thomas P.] Univ Washington, Sch Aquat & Fishery Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [O'Malley, Kathleen G.] Oregon State Univ, Newport, OR USA; [Spidle, Adrian] Northwest Indian Fisheries Commiss, Olympia, WA USA","National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of Montana System; University of Montana; Michigan State University; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Washington Department of Fish & Wildlife (WDFW); University of California System; University of California Davis; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; Oregon State University","Waples, RS (corresponding author), Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Northwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, 2725 Montlake Blvd East, Seattle, WA 98112 USA.","robin.waples@noaa.gov","Naish, Kerry/F-5768-2014; Miller, Matthew/AAO-1898-2020; OMalley, Kathleen/ABF-7373-2020; Waples, Robin/K-1126-2016","","","","",NA,196,26,26,3,20,"OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC","CARY","JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA","0022-1503","1465-7333","","J HERED","J.

In such cases, molecular genetics and genomic approaches are useful to assess mating systems and operational sex ratios (OSR), which ultimately influence demography. This pilot study used genomewide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genetic markers for exploring kinship and mating systems in sea turtles where major obstacles prevent a comprehensive assessment in the wild. We sampled 217 young hawksbill turtles (Eretmochelys imbricata) of unknown parentage that had originally been collected locally from seven nests and were being temporarily kept in captivity by Treasure Island Ltd as part of its captive rearing conservation project at Bounty and Treasure Islands, Fiji, in the South Pacific. The raw dataset comprised 13,573 SNPs, of which we retained 639 SNPs for parentage and relatedness analyses. Our findings from seven different pairs of parents suggest a 1:1 male:female OSR and demonstrate that genome-wide SNP genotyping approaches can be used to infer OSR. Knowledge of OSR can help evaluate the magnitude of the impact of warming temperatures and consequent feminisation in sea turtles. Our approach can complement or substitute field observation of breeding males and nesting females when logistical or budgetary constraints prevent observation of OSR in wild sea turtle populations. This approach allows inference of OSR. Protection of beaches with a higher number of pairs of parents should be prioritised to increase genetic resilience. Conservation actions in rookeries with a female-skewed OSR should be prioritised to address population declines in the long run. (C) 2022 The Author(s).

It is the most popular swimming area in the Hawaiian Islands and has been reported to have averaged between 2.8 and 3.5 million visitors a year between the 1980s and the 2010s, with visitors averaging between 3000-4000 a day and peaking around 10,000-13,000 per day. Concentrations of oxybenzone and other common UV filters were measured in subsurface water samples and in sands from the beach-shower areas in Hanauma Bay. Results demonstrate that beach showers also can be a source of sunscreen environmental contamination. Hydrodynamic modeling indicates that oxybenzone contamination within Hanauma Bay's waters could be retained between 14 , 50 h from a single release event period. Focusing on only oxybenzone, two different Hazard and Risk Assessment analyses were conducted to determine the danger of oxybenzone to Hanauma Bay's coral reef system. Results indicate that oxybenzone contamination poses a significant threat to the wildlife of Hanauma Bay. To recover Hanauma Bay's natural resources to a healthy condition and to satis-factorily conserve its coral reef and sea grass habitats, effective tourism management policies need to be implemented that mitigate the threat of sunscreen pollution.","[Downs, C.

Recent advancements in long-read and long-range genome sequencing have made it possible to produce high-quality chromosome-level genome assemblies for almost any organism. However, adequate tissue preservation for the requisite ultra-high molecular weight DNA (uHMW DNA) remains a major challenge. Here we present a comparative study of preservation methods for field and laboratory tissue sampling, across vertebrate classes and different tissue types. Results We find that storage temperature was the strongest predictor of uHMW fragment lengths. While immediate flash-freezing remains the sample preservation gold standard, samples preserved in 95% EtOH or 20-25% DMSO-EDTA showed little fragment length degradation when stored at 4 degrees C for 6 hours. Samples in 95% EtOH or 20-25% DMSO-EDTA kept at 4 degrees C for 1 week after dissection still yielded adequate amounts of uHMW DNA for most applications. Tissue type was a significant predictor of total DNA yield but not fragment length. Preservation solution had a smaller but significant influence on both fragment length and DNA yield. Conclusion We provide sample preservation guidelines that ensure sufficient DNA integrity and amount required for use with long-read and long-range sequencing technologies across vertebrates. Our best practices generated the uHMW DNA needed for the high-quality reference genomes for phase 1 of the Vertebrate Genomes Project, whose ultimate mission is to generate chromosome-level reference genome assemblies of all similar to 70,000 extant vertebrate species.","[Dahn, Hollis A.; Murphy, Robert W.] Univ Toronto, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Toronto, ON M5S 3B2, Canada; [Mountcastle, Jacquelyn; Balacco, Jennifer; Formenti, Giulio; Brown, Samara; Jarvis, Erich D.; Fedrigo, Olivier] Rockefeller Univ, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Winkler, Sylke; Tan, Wenhua; Kraus, Anne] Max Planck Inst Mol Cell Biol & Genet, D-01307 Saxony, Germany; [Bista, Iliana; Oliver, Karen; Smith, Michelle] Wellcome Sanger Inst, Tree Life Program, Hinxton CB10 1SA, Cambs, England; [Bista, Iliana] Univ Cambridge, Dept Genet, Cambridge CB2 3EH, Cambs, England; [Schmitt, Anthony D.; Mac, Stephen] Arima Genom Inc, San Diego, CA 92121 USA; [Pettersson, Olga Vinnere] Uppsala Univ, SciLifeLab, Natl Genom Infrastruct, S-75108 Uppsala, Sweden; [Komoroske, Lisa M.; Lama, Tanya] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Environm Conservat, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Crawford, Andrew J.] Univ Los Andes, Dept Biol Sci, Bogota 111711, Colombia; [Scott, Alan F.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Med, Baltimore, MD 21287 USA; [Morin, Phillip A.] NOAA, Southwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Jarvis, Erich D.] Howard Hughes Med Inst, Chevy Chase, MD 20815 USA","University of Toronto; Rockefeller University; Max Planck Society; Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute; University of Cambridge; SciLifeLab; Uppsala University; University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst; Universidad de los Andes (Colombia); Johns Hopkins University; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Howard Hughes Medical Institute","Fedrigo, O (corresponding author), Rockefeller Univ, Vertebrate Genome Lab, 1230 York Ave,Box 366, New York, NY 10065 USA.","ofedrigo@rockefeller.edu","Murphy, Robert/D-8586-2011; Jarvis, Erich/A-2319-2008; Bista, Iliana/AFM-5294-2022; Formenti, Giulio/GRX-8689-2022; Crawford, Andrew J./G-6365-2012","Balacco, Jennifer/0000-0001-7102-1632; Smith, Michelle/0000-0001-5288-0001; Mountcastle, Jacquelyn/0000-0003-1078-4905; Formenti, Giulio/0000-0002-7554-5991; Bista, Iliana/0000-0002-6155-3093; Crawford, Andrew J./0000-0003-3153-6898","Rockefeller University Startup funds; Howard Hughes Medical Institute Funds; Max Planck Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics; Wellcome Trust; Wellcome [WT207492, 104640/Z/14/Z, 092096/Z/10/Z]; Wellcome Trust [092096/Z/10/Z, 104640/Z/14/Z] Funding Source: Wellcome Trust","Rockefeller University Startup funds; Howard Hughes Medical Institute Funds; Max Planck Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics; Wellcome Trust(Wellcome Trust); Wellcome(Wellcome Trust); Wellcome Trust(Wellcome Trust)","This research was supported by Howard Hughes Medical Institute Funds and Rockefeller University Startup funds to E.D.J., institutional funds of the Max Planck Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics, and funds by the Wellcome Trust made out to DNAP R&D team at Wellcome Sanger Institute.

Larval coregonines from the Apostle Islands, Lake Superior, were genotyped using restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (RADseq) and were assigned to species using reference genotypes from adult corgonines from the same region. Of the 193 genotyped larvae, 101 were assigned as Coregonus artedi (average assignment probability = 97.6%), 57 were assigned as C. kiyi (average assignment probability = 95.5%), and 28 were assigned as C. hoyi (average assignment probability = 89.0%). Coregonus artedi were collected earliest in the season, followed by C. kiyi and then C. hoyi. Estimates of genetic diversity within each species provide a baseline for future monitoring in the Apostle Islands. Our success with species assignment indicates the promise of leveraging genomic data for larval coregonine identification, which could enable assessing and evaluating early life history dynamics and recruitment processes at the species level to the benefit of ongoing coregonine restoration and management efforts.

In marine systems, determining the scale, rate, and directionality of larval dispersal is therefore, central to understanding how coral metapopulations are interconnected and the degree of resiliency in the event of a localized disturbance. Understanding these source-sink dynamics is essential to guide restoration efforts and for the study of ecology and evolution in the ocean. The patterns and mechanisms of connectivity in the deep-sea (>200 m deep) are largely understudied. In this study, we investigated the spatial diversity patterns and metapopulation connectivity of the octocoral Paramuricea biscaya throughout the northern Gulf of Mexico (GoM). Paramuricea biscaya is one of the most abundant corals on the lower continental slope (between 1,200 and 2,500 m) in the GoM. The 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill (DWH) directly impacted populations of this species and thus are considered primary targets for restoration. We used a combination of seascape genomic analyses, high-resolution ocean circulation modeling, and larval dispersal simulations to quantify the degree of population structuring and connectivity among P. biscaya populations. Evidence supports the hypotheses that the genetic diversity of P. biscaya is structured by depth, and that larval dispersal among connected populations is asymmetric due to dominant ocean circulation patterns. Our results suggest that there are intermediate unsampled populations in the central GoM that serve as stepping stones for dispersal. The data suggest that the DeSoto Canyon area, and possibly the West Florida Escarpment, critically act as sources of larvae for areas impacted by the DWH oil spill in the Mississippi Canyon. This work illustrates that the management of deep-sea marine protected areas should incorporate knowledge of connectivity networks and depth-dependent processes throughout the water column.","[Galaska, Matthew P.; West, Destiny; Herrera, Santiago] Lehigh Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Coll Arts & Sci, Bethlehem, PA 18015 USA; [Galaska, Matthew P.] Univ Washington, Cooperat Inst Climate Ocean & Ecosyst Studies, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Galaska, Matthew P.] NOAA, Pacific Marine Environm Lab, 7600 Sand Point Way Ne, Seattle, WA 98115 USA; [Liu, Guangpeng; Bracco, Annalisa] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Earth & Atmospher Sci, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Erickson, Katie] Harvey Mudd Coll, Dept Biol, Claremont, CA 91711 USA; [Quattrini, Andrea M.] Smithsonian Inst, Dept Invertebrate Zool, Natl Museum Nat Hist, Washington, DC 20560 USA","Lehigh University; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology; Claremont Colleges; Harvey Mudd College; Smithsonian Institution; Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History","Herrera, S (corresponding author), Lehigh Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Coll Arts & Sci, Bethlehem, PA 18015 USA.","santiago.herrera@lehigh.edu","Galaska, Mathew/L-3948-2019; Erickson, Katie/JWA-3088-2024; Herrera, Santiago/E-5953-2011","Erickson, Katie/0000-0001-5629-1917; Herrera, Santiago/0000-0001-7204-9434; Galaska, Matthew/0000-0002-4257-0170; Quattrini, Andrea/0000-0002-4247-3055","","","",NA,116,6,6,3,25,"FRONTIERS MEDIA SA","LAUSANNE","AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND","","2296-7745","","FRONT MAR SCI","Front.

However, small populations may be able to purge recessive deleterious alleles as they become expressed in homozygotes, thus reducing inbreeding depression and increasing population viability. We used whole-genome sequences from 57 tigers to estimate individual inbreeding and mutation load in a small-isolated and two large-connected populations in India. As expected, the small-isolated population had substantially higher average genomic inbreeding (F-ROH = 0.57) than the large-connected (F-ROH = 0.35 and F-ROH = 0.46) populations. The small-isolated population had the lowest loss-of-function mutation load, likely due to purging of highly deleterious recessive mutations. The large populations had lower missense mutation loads than the small-isolated population, but were not identical, possibly due to different demographic histories. While the number of the loss-of-function alleles in the small-isolated population was lower, these alleles were at higher frequencies and homozygosity than in the large populations. Together, our data and analyses provide evidence of 1) high mutation load, 2) purging, and 3) the highest predicted inbreeding depression, despite purging, in the small-isolated population. Frequency distributions of damaging and neutral alleles uncover genomic evidence that purifying selection has removed part of the mutation load across Indian tiger populations. These results provide genomic evidence for purifying selection in both small and large populations, but also suggest that the remaining deleterious alleles may have inbreeding-associated fitness costs. We suggest that genetic rescue from sources selected based on genome-wide differentiation could offset any possible impacts of inbreeding depression.","[Khan, Anubhab; Patel, Kaushalkumar; Shukla, Harsh; Viswanathan, Ashwin; Ramakrishnan, Uma] Tata Inst Fundamental Res, Natl Ctr Biol Sci, Bangalore 560065, Karnataka, India; [Viswanathan, Ashwin] Nat Conservat Fdn, Mysore 570017, Karnataka, India; [van der Valk, Tom] Swedish Museum Nat Hist, S-4011418 Stockholm, Sweden; [Borthakur, Udayan] Aranyak, Gauhati 781028, India; [Nigam, Parag; Jhala, Yadavendradev, V] Wildlife Inst India, Dehra Dun 248001, Uttarakhand, India; [Zachariah, Arun] Kerala Forest Dept, Wayanad 670645, India; [Kardos, Marty] NOAA, Northwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Seattle, WA 98112 USA; [Ramakrishnan, Uma] Wellcome Trust India Alliance, Dept Biotechnol, Hyderabad 500034, India","Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR); National Centre for Biological Sciences (NCBS); Swedish Museum of Natural History; Wildlife Institute of India; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA","Khan, A; Ramakrishnan, U (corresponding author), Tata Inst Fundamental Res, Natl Ctr Biol Sci, Bangalore 560065, Karnataka, India.;Kardos, M (corresponding author), NOAA, Northwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Seattle, WA 98112 USA.;Ramakrishnan, U (corresponding author), Wellcome Trust India Alliance, Dept Biotechnol, Hyderabad 500034, India.","anubhabkhan@gmail.com; martin.kardos@noaa.gov; uramakri@ncbs.res.in","","Ramakrishnan, Uma/0000-0002-5370-5966; Khan, Anubhab/0000-0002-6342-6522; Kardos, Marty/0000-0002-7587-3004; Nigam, Parag/0000-0001-9472-6897; Viswanathan, Ashwin/0000-0002-1605-0614","Department of Biotechnology/Wellcome Trust India Alliance Fellowship [IA/S/16/2/502714]; SciGenome Research Foundation; Department of Atomic Energy, Government of India [12RD-TFR-5.04-0900]","Department of Biotechnology/Wellcome Trust India Alliance Fellowship; SciGenome Research Foundation; Department of Atomic Energy, Government of India(Department of Atomic Energy (DAE))","This work was supported primarily by a Department of Biotechnology/Wellcome Trust India Alliance Fellowship (IA/S/16/2/502714) (awarded to U.R.).

Several recent genomic and simulation-based studies have argued that the field of conservation biology has placed too much focus on conserving genome-wide genetic variation, and that the field should instead focus on managing the subset of functional genetic variation that is thought to affect fitness. Here, we critically evaluate the feasibility and likely benefits of this approach in conservation. We find that population genetics theory and empirical results show that conserving genome-wide genetic variation is generally the best approach to prevent inbreeding depression and loss of adaptive potential from driving populations toward extinction. Focusing conservation efforts on presumably functional genetic variation will only be feasible occasionally, often misleading, and counterproductive when prioritized over genome-wide genetic variation. Given the increasing rate of habitat loss and other environmental changes, failure to recognize the detrimental effects of lost genome-wide genetic variation on long-term population viability will only worsen the biodiversity crisis.","[Kardos, Marty] NOAA, Northwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Seattle, WA 98112 USA; [Armstrong, Ellie E.] Stanford Univ, Dept Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Fitzpatrick, Sarah W.] Michigan State Univ, WK Kellogg Biol Stn, Hickory Corners, MI 49060 USA; [Fitzpatrick, Sarah W.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Integrat Biol, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Fitzpatrick, Sarah W.] Michigan State Univ, Ecol Evolut & Behav Program, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Hauser, Samantha] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Biol Sci, Milwaukee, WI 53211 USA; [Hedrick, Philip W.] Arizona State Univ, Sch Life Sci, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Miller, Joshua M.] San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance, Escondido, CA 92027 USA; [Miller, Joshua M.] Polar Bears Int, Bozeman, MT 59772 USA; [Miller, Joshua M.] MacEwan Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Edmonton, AB T5J 4S2, Canada; [Tallmon, David A.] Univ Alaska Southeast, Biol & Marine Biol Program, Juneau, AK 99801 USA; [Funk, W.

The dueling effects of selection and drift in a limited pool of genetic diversity make the responses of small populations to environmental perturbations erratic and difficult to predict. This is particularly true at the edge of a species range, where populations often persist at the limits of their environmental tolerances. Populations of cisco, Coregonus artedi, in inland lakes have experienced numerous extirpations along the southern edge of their range in recent decades, which are thought to result from environmental degradation and loss of cold, well-oxygenated habitat as lakes warm. Yet, cisco extirpations do not show a clear latitudinal pattern, suggesting that local environmental factors and potentially local adaptation may influence resilience. Here, we used genomic tools to investigate the nature of this pattern of resilience. We used restriction site-associated DNA capture (Rapture) sequencing to survey genomic diversity and differentiation in southern inland lake cisco populations and compared the frequency of deleterious mutations that potentially influence fitness across lakes. We also examined haplotype diversity in a region of the major histocompatibility complex involved in stress and immune system response. We correlated these metrics to spatial and environmental factors including latitude, lake size, and measures of oxythermal habitat and found significant relationships between genetic metrics and broad and local factors. High levels of genetic differentiation among populations were punctuated by a phylogeographic break and residual patterns of isolation-by-distance. Although the prevalence of deleterious mutations and inbreeding coefficients was significantly correlated with latitude, neutral and non-neutral genetic diversity were most strongly correlated with lake surface area. Notably, differences among lakes in the availability of estimated oxythermal habitat left no clear population genomic signature. Our results shed light on the complex dynamics influencing these isolated populations and provide valuable information for their conservation.","[Ackiss, Amanda S.; Turnquist, Keith] Univ Wisconsin, Coll Nat Resources, Wisconsin Cooperat Fishery Res Unit, Stevens Point, WI 54481 USA; [Ackiss, Amanda S.] US Geol Survey, Great Lakes Sci Ctr, 1451 Green Rd, Ann Arbor, MI 48105 USA; [Magee, Madeline R.] Wisconsin Dept Nat Resources, Madison, WI USA; [Sass, Greg G.] Wisconsin Dept Nat Resources, Escanaba Lake Res Stn, Boulder Jct, WI USA; [McIntyre, Peter B.] Cornell Univ, Dept Nat Resources & Environm, Ithaca, NY USA; [Larson, Wesley A.] Univ Wisconsin, Coll Nat Resources, US Geol Survey, Wisconsin Cooperat Fishery Res Unit, Stevens Point, WI 54481 USA; [Larson, Wesley A.] NOAA, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Alaska Fisheries Sci Ctr, Auke Bay Labs, Juneau, AK USA","University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Stevens Point; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; Cornell University; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Stevens Point; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA","Ackiss, AS (corresponding author), US Geol Survey, Great Lakes Sci Ctr, 1451 Green Rd, Ann Arbor, MI 48105 USA.","aackiss@usgs.gov","Ackiss, Amanda/AAD-4849-2019; Magee, Madeline/ITW-0614-2023","McIntyre, Peter/0000-0003-1809-7552; Ackiss, Amanda/0000-0002-8726-7423","Packard Fellowship; Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources; U.S. Geological Survey; US Fish and Wildlife Service","Packard Fellowship(The David & Lucile Packard Foundation); Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources; U.S. Geological Survey(United States Geological Survey); US Fish and Wildlife Service(US Fish & Wildlife Service)","Packard Fellowship; Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources; U.S. Geological Survey; US Fish and Wildlife Service",NA,139,5,7,2,15,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","1752-4571","","","EVOL APPL","Evol.

The goal of our study was to describe FP in Kemp's ridley turtles, including estimated disease prevalence and pathologyg, and case demographics and outcomes, to better understand the risk posed by FP to Kemp's ridley population recovery. During 2006-2020, we identified 22 cases of Kemp's ridley turtles with FP, including 12 adult turtles, a reproductively valuable age class. Molecular diagnostics were used to identify ChHV5 DNA in blood (7.8%) and tumor (91.7%) samples collected from free-ranging Kemp's ridley turtles. Genomic sequencing was conducted to identify ChHV5 variants in tumor samples collected from Kemp's ridley turtles with FP. Along with case data, phylogenetic analysis of resultant sequences suggests increasing, spatiotemporal spread of ChHV5 infections and FP among Kemp's ridley turtles in coastal areas, including the Gulf of Mexico and the southwestern Atlantic Ocean, where they share habitat with green sea turtles (in which FP is enzootic). This is concerning because FP has an uncertain pathogenesis, is potentially related to anthropogenic environmental degradation, and can cause suffering and/or death in severely afflicted turtles. Fibropapillomatosis (FP), a debilitating, infectious neoplastic disease, is rarely reported in endangered Kemp's ridley sea turtles (Lepidochelys kempii). With this study, we describe FP and the associated chelonid alphaherpesvirus 5 (ChHV5) in Kemp's ridley turtles encountered in the United States during 2006-2020. Analysis of 22 case reports of Kemp's ridley turtles with FP revealed that while the disease was mild in most cases, 54.5% were adult turtles, a reproductively valuable age class whose survival is a priority for population recovery. Of 51 blood samples from tumor-free turtles and 12 tumor samples from turtles with FP, 7.8% and 91.7%, respectively, tested positive for ChHV5 DNA via quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Viral genome shotgun sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of six tumor samples show that ChHV5 sequences in Kemp's ridley turtles encountered in the Gulf of Mexico and northwestern Atlantic cluster with ChHV5 sequences identified in green (Chelonia mydas) and loggerhead (Caretta caretta) sea turtles from Hawaii, the southwestern Atlantic Ocean, and the Caribbean. Results suggest an interspecific, spatiotemporal spread of FP among Kemp's ridley turtles in regions where the disease is enzootic. Although FP is currently uncommon in this species, it remains a health concern due to its uncertain pathogenesis and potential relationship with habitat degradation.","[Page-Karjian, Annie; Rantonen, Elina] Florida Atlantic Univ, Harbor Branch Oceanog Inst, Ft Pierce, FL 34946 USA; [Whitmore, Liam; Farrell, Jessica A.; Yetsko, Kelsey; Duffy, David J.] Univ Florida, Whitney Lab Marine Biosci, St Augustine, FL 32080 USA; [Whitmore, Liam; Farrell, Jessica A.; Yetsko, Kelsey; Duffy, David J.] Univ Florida, Sea Turtle Hosp, St Augustine, FL 32080 USA; [Whitmore, Liam] Univ Limerick, Dept Biol Sci, Limerick V94 T9PX, Limerick, Ireland; [Stacy, Brian A.] NOAA, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Perrault, Justin R.] Loggerhead Marinelife Ctr, Juno Beach, FL 33408 USA; [Farrell, Jessica A.; Duffy, David J.] Univ Florida, Dept Biol, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Shaver, Donna J.; Walker, J.

Use of molecular techniques has expanded the variety of species for which pedigrees can be constructed. However, molecular pedigrees almost exclusively consider microsatellite loci, despite advances in high-throughput sequencing allowing development of genomic marker sets in nearly any organism. Here we generate a novel set of genomic SNPs derived from ddRAD sequencing in two populations of Weddell seals (Leptonychotes weddellii) and describe the diversity and differentiation between them. We then compare and contrast parentage assignment rates and accuracy in one population that has been the subject of long-term monitoring. Specifically, we consider pedigrees constructed using two sets of markers (microsatellites and SNPs), two pedigree construction software (CERVUS than Sequoia), as well as varying the groupings of candidate parents (either all individuals simultaneously, only individuals born before a focal year, or only individuals known to have survived to a focal year). ddRAD sequencing returned between 1568 and 3240 loci depending on whether both populations were considered simultaneously or individually. Parentage assignment rates were always higher using CERVUS than Sequoia, with the latter at times either not assigning parentage or creating inferred parents. In all cases, polarizing the datasets (e.g., including year of birth) significantly improved assignments. This represents one of the first direct comparisons of pedigree construction using different markers in the same set of individuals, and the SNPs described here will be a resource for continued pedigree construction, and future research in Weddell seals.","[Miller, Joshua M.; Campbell, Erin O.; Davis, Corey S.] Univ Alberta, Dept Biol Sci, Edmonton, AB, Canada; [Rotella, Jay J.; Macdonald, Kaitlin R.] Montana State Univ, Ecol Dept, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA; [Gelatt, Thomas S.] NOAA Fisheries, Alaska Fisheries Sci Ctr, Seattle, WA USA","University of Alberta; Montana State University System; Montana State University Bozeman; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA","Miller, JM (corresponding author), Univ Alberta, Dept Biol Sci, Edmonton, AB, Canada.","jmm1@ualberta.ca","macdonald, kaitlin/HDM-3845-2022; Miller, Joshua/E-3072-2013; Davis, Corey/I-4058-2014; Miller, Joshua/J-3393-2014","Davis, Corey/0000-0003-4362-0659; Rotella, Jay/0000-0001-7014-7524; Miller, Joshua/0000-0002-4019-7675","National Science Foundation, Division of Polar Programs [ANT-1141326, ANT-1640481]","National Science Foundation, Division of Polar Programs(National Science Foundation (NSF))","Field work to collect tissue samples was supported by the National Science Foundation, Division of Polar Programs under grant numbers ANT-1141326 and ANT-1640481 to J.

Averaging across loci as if they were independent creates pseudoreplication, which reduces the effective degrees of freedom (df') compared to the nominal degrees of freedom, df. This issue has been known for some time, but consequences have not been systematically quantified across the entire genome. Here, we measured pseudoreplication (quantified by the ratio df'/df) for a common metric of genetic differentiation (F-ST) and a common measure of linkage disequilibrium between pairs of loci (r(2)). Based on data simulated using models (SLiM and msprime) that allow efficient forward-in-time and coalescent simulations while precisely controlling population pedigrees, we estimated df' and df'/df by measuring the rate of decline in the variance of mean F-ST and mean r(2) as more loci were used. For both indices, df' increases with N-e and genome size, as expected. However, even for large N-e and large genomes, df' for mean r(2) plateaus after a few thousand loci, and a variance components analysis indicates that the limiting factor is uncertainty associated with sampling individuals rather than genes. Pseudoreplication is less extreme for F-ST, but df'/df <= 0.01 can occur in data sets using tens of thousands of loci. Commonly-used block-jackknife methods consistently overestimated var (F-ST), producing very conservative confidence intervals. Predicting df' based on our modelling results as a function of N-e, L, S, and genome size provides a robust way to quantify precision associated with genomic-scale data sets.","[Waples, Robin S.; Ward, Eric J.] NOAA Fisheries, Northwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Seattle, WA 98115 USA; [Waples, Ryan K.] Univ Copenhagen, Sect Computat & RNA Biol, Dept Biol, Copenhagen, Denmark","National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of Copenhagen","Waples, RS (corresponding author), NOAA Fisheries, Northwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Seattle, WA 98115 USA.","robin.waples@noaa.gov","Waples, Robin/K-1126-2016","Waples, Ryan/0000-0003-0526-6425","","","",NA,63,22,22,0,14,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","1755-098X","1755-0998","","MOL ECOL RESOUR","Mol.

There is a consequent need to characterize the responses of corals to thermal stress to understand the molecular processes underpinning these responses and identify hallmarks of resilience. Here we used an iTRAQ approach to compare the proteomes of adult corals (Pocillopora acuta) that had been thermally conditioned at a control (26 degrees C) or elevated temperature (29.5 degrees C) for three reproductive cycles, as well as the larvae released by these corals. We found that larvae responded more to high-temperature exposure at the protein level than their parents and that different proteins were affected between life stages; a single protein was up-regulated at high temperatures in both adults and their offspring, and its identity is currently unknown. Similarly, different cellular pathways were affected by high-temperature exposure between the coral hosts and their dinoflagellate endosymbionts; proteins involved in translation and protein trafficking were most likely to be affected by high-temperature exposure in the former, with photosynthesis being the most thermo-sensitive process in the latter. Collectively, these findings highlight the importance of considering both life stage and the composition of the coral holobiont when using molecular-scale data to model cellular processes associated with responses to future ocean warming.","[McRae, Crystal J.; Cote, Isabelle M.] Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Burnaby, BC, Canada; [McRae, Crystal J.; Huang, Wen-Bin] Natl Dong Hwa Univ, Dept Nat Resources & Environm Studies, Hualien, Taiwan; [Mayfield, Anderson B.; Fan, Tung-Yung] Natl Museum Marine Biol & Aquarium, Pingtung, Taiwan; [Mayfield, Anderson B.] Univ Miami, Cooperat Inst Marine & Atmospher Studies, Miami, FL USA; [Mayfield, Anderson B.] NOAA, Atlantic Oceanog & Meteorol Lab, Miami, FL 33149 USA; [Fan, Tung-Yung] Natl Dong Hwa Univ, Inst Marine Biol, Pingtung, Taiwan","Simon Fraser University; National Dong Hwa University; National Museum of Marine Biology & Aquarium; University of Miami; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Atlantic Oceanographic & Meteorological Laboratory (AOML); National Dong Hwa University","McRae, CJ (corresponding author), Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Burnaby, BC, Canada.;McRae, CJ (corresponding author), Natl Dong Hwa Univ, Dept Nat Resources & Environm Studies, Hualien, Taiwan.","crystal.j.mcrae@gmail.com","Cote, Isabelle/ABD-5898-2021","Mayfield, Anderson/0000-0003-0138-7844","Taiwan Ministry of Science and Technology [107-2611-M-291-004]","Taiwan Ministry of Science and Technology","This work was funded in part by charitable, crowd-sourced contributions to the Friendly Bear Editorial Service, as well as a grant from the Taiwan Ministry of Science and Technology to TYF (107-2611-M-291-004).",NA,25,5,5,1,13,"FRONTIERS MEDIA SA","LAUSANNE","AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND","","2296-7745","","FRONT MAR SCI","Front.

We examine both complex (supergene) and simple (SNP) genetic variants occurring in populations of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) independently isolated from ocean access and compared them to each other and to an anadromous below-barrier population representing their ancestral source to search for signatures of both parallel and nonparallel adaptation. All landlocked populations displayed an increased frequency of a large inversion on chromosome Omy05, while 3 of the 4 populations exhibited elevated frequencies of another inversion located on chromosome Omy20. In addition, we identified numerous regions outside these 2 inversions that also show significant shifts in allele frequencies consistent with adaptive evolution. However, there was little concordance among above-barrier populations in these specific genomic regions under selection. In part, the lack of concordance appears to arise from ancestral autopolyploidy in rainbow trout that provides duplicate genomic regions of similar functional composition for selection to act upon. Thus, while selection acting on landlocked populations universally favors the resident ecotype, outside of the major chromosomal inversions, the resulting genetic changes are largely distinct among populations. Our results indicate that selection on standing genetic variation is likely the primary mode of rapid adaptation, and that both supergene complexes and individual loci contribute to adaptive evolution, further highlighting the diversity of adaptive genomic variation involved in complex phenotypic evolution.","[Campbell, Matthew A.; Pearse, Devon E.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 1156 High St, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Campbell, Matthew A.; Anderson, Eric C.; Garza, John Carlos; Pearse, Devon E.] Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Southwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Fisheries Ecol Div, 110 McAllister Way, Santa Cruz, CA 95060 USA","University of California System; University of California Santa Cruz; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA","Pearse, DE (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 1156 High St, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.;Pearse, DE (corresponding author), Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Southwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Fisheries Ecol Div, 110 McAllister Way, Santa Cruz, CA 95060 USA.","Devon.Pearse@NOAA.gov","","Pearse, Devon/0000-0003-1934-6493; Campbell, Matthew/0000-0002-5826-0329","California Department of Fish and Wildlife (Fisheries Restoration Grant Program) [125001]; US Bureau of Reclamation [BR15PG0006]","California Department of Fish and Wildlife (Fisheries Restoration Grant Program); US Bureau of Reclamation","This work was supported by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (Fisheries Restoration Grant Program, award #125001) and the US Bureau of Reclamation (award #BR15PG0006).",NA,83,9,9,0,2,"OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC","CARY","JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA","0022-1503","1465-7333","","J HERED","J.

Resource managers track the multitude of permits, species, restoration locations, and performance across multiple stakeholders while researchers generate large data sets and data pipelines detailing the genetic, genomic, and phenotypic variants of corals. Restoration practitioners, in turn, maintain records on fragment collection, genet performance, outplanting location and survivorship. While each data set is important in its own right, collectively they can provide deeper insights into coral biology and better guide coral restoration endeavors - unfortunately, current data sets are siloed with limited ability to cross-mine information for deeper insights and hypothesis testing. Herein we present the Coral Sample Registry (CSR), an online resource that establishes the first step in integrating diverse coral restoration data sets. Developed in collaboration with academia, management agencies, and restoration practitioners in the South Florida area, the CSR centralizes information on sample collection events by issuing a unique accession number to each entry. Accession numbers can then be incorporated into existing and future data structures. Each accession number is unique and corresponds to a specific collection event of coral tissue, whether for research, archiving, or restoration purposes. As such the accession number can serve as the key to unlock the diversity of information related to that sample's provenance and characteristics across any and all data structures that include the accession number field. The CSR is open-source and freely available to users, designed to be suitable for all coral species in all geographic regions. Our goal is that this resource will be adopted by researchers, restoration practitioners, and managers to efficiently track coral samples through all data structures and thus enable the unlocking of a broader array of insights.","[Moura, Amelia; Winters, R.

However, a recent critique of genomic data-based species delimitation approaches is that they have the potential to conflate population structure with species diversity, resulting in taxonomic oversplitting. The need for an integrative approach to species delimitation, in which molecular, morphological, ecological, and geographic lines of evidence are evaluated together, is becoming increasingly apparent. Here, we integrate phylogenetic, population genetic, and coalescent analyses of genome-wide sequence data with investigation of variation in multiple morphological traits to delimit species within the Antarctic barbeled plunderfishes (Artedidraconidae: Pogonophryne). Pogonophryne currently comprises 29 valid species, most of which are distinguished solely by variation in the ornamentation of the mental barbel that projects from the lower jaw, a structure previously shown to vary widely within a single species. However, our genomic and phenotypic analyses result in a dramatic reduction in the number of distinct species recognized within the clade, providing evidence to support the recognition of no more than six species. We propose to synonymize 24 of the currently recognized species with five species of Pogonophryne. We find genomic and phenotypic evidence for a new species of Pogonophryne from specimens collected in the Ross Sea. Our findings represent a rare example in which the application of molecular data provides evidence of taxonomic oversplitting on the basis of morphology, clearly demonstrating the utility of an integrative species delimitation framework.","[Parker, Elyse; Near, Thomas J.] Yale Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, POB 208106, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Dornburg, Alex] Univ N Carolina, Dept Bioinformat & Genom, Charlotte, NC 28223 USA; [Struthers, Carl D.] Museum New Zealand Papa Tongarewa, Wellington, New Zealand; [Jones, Christopher D.] NOAA, Antarctic Ecosyst Res Div, Southwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Near, Thomas J.] Yale Univ, Peabody Museum Nat Hist, New Haven, CT 06520 USA","Yale University; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Charlotte; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Yale University","Parker, E (corresponding author), Yale Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, POB 208106, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.","chantul.parker@yale.edu","Near, Thomas/K-1204-2012; Dornburg, Alex/CAF-1206-2022","Near, Thomas/0000-0002-7398-6670","Bingham Oceanographic Fund, Peabody Museum ofNatural History, Yale University","Bingham Oceanographic Fund, Peabody Museum ofNatural History, Yale University","This research was supported by the Bingham Oceanographic Fund, Peabody Museum ofNatural History, Yale University.",NA,144,21,23,2,13,"OXFORD UNIV PRESS","OXFORD","GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","1063-5157","1076-836X","","SYST BIOL","Syst.

Metabolomics is useful for identifying physiological drivers leading to variation among genotypes and has the capacity to improve our selection of candidate corals that express phenotypes beneficial to restoration. Objectives Our study aims to compare metabolomic profiles among known, unique genotypes of the threatened coral Acropora cervicornis. In doing so, we seek information related to the physiological characteristics driving variation among genotypes, which could aid in identifying genets with desirable traits for restoration. Methods We applied proton nuclear magnetic resonance (H-1-NMR) and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) to identify and compare metabolomic profiles for seven unique genotypes of A. cervicornis that previously exhibited phenotypic variation in a common garden coral nursery. Results Significant variation in polar and nonpolar metabolite profiles was found among A. cervicornis genotypes. Despite difficulties identifying all significant metabolites driving separation among genotypes, our data support previous findings and further suggest metabolomic profiles differ among various genotypes of the threatened species A. cervicornis. Conclusion The implementation of metabolomic analyses allowed identification of several key metabolites driving separation among genotypes and expanded our understanding of the A. cervicornis metabolome. Although our research is specific to A. cervicornis, these findings have broad relevance for coral biology and active restoration. Furthermore, this study provides specific information on the understudied A. cervicornis metabolome and further confirmation that differences in metabolome structure could drive phenotypic variation among genotypes.","[Henry, Joseph A.] Univ Florida, Sch Forest Fisheries & Geomat Sci, IFAS, Program Fisheries & Aquat Sci, 7922 NW 71St St, Gainesville, FL 32653 USA; [Khattri, Ram B.; Merritt, Matthew E.] Univ Florida, Coll Med, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Gainesville, FL 32610 USA; [Guingab-Cagmat, Joy] Univ Florida, Coll Med, Dept Pathol Immunol & Lab Med, Gainesville, FL USA; [Garrett, Timothy J.] Florida Aquarium, Ctr Conservat, 529 Estuary Shore Ln, Apollo Beach, FL 33572 USA; [Patterson, Joshua T.; Lohr, Kathryn E.] NOAA, Off Natl Marine Sanctuaries, Silver Spring, MD USA; [Patterson, Joshua T.] Univ Florida, Southeast Ctr Integrated Metabol, Clin & Translat Sci Inst, Gainesville, FL USA","State University System of Florida; University of Florida; State University System of Florida; University of Florida; State University System of Florida; University of Florida; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; State University System of Florida; University of Florida","Henry, JA (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Sch Forest Fisheries & Geomat Sci, IFAS, Program Fisheries & Aquat Sci, 7922 NW 71St St, Gainesville, FL 32653 USA.","henry8404@ufl.edu","KHATTRI, Ram/X-1126-2019","Henry, Joseph/0000-0001-6843-2094; Merritt, Matthew/0000-0003-4617-9651; Lohr, Kathryn/0000-0002-3580-3431; Khattri, Ram/0000-0001-9991-263X","University of Florida's Southeast Center for Integrated Metabolomics from the National Institute of Health's Common Fund metabolomics program [U24DK097209]; USDA/NIFA HATCH project [FLA-FOR-005902]; National Science Foundation [DMR-1644779]; State of Florida","University of Florida's Southeast Center for Integrated Metabolomics from the National Institute of Health's Common Fund metabolomics program; USDA/NIFA HATCH project; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); State of Florida","This publication was made possible by the University of Florida's Southeast Center for Integrated Metabolomics through grant number U24DK097209 from the National Institute of Health's Common Fund metabolomics program.

However, estimating contemporary N-e is difficult and in practice this parameter is often unknown. In principle, contemporary N-e can be estimated using either analyses of temporal changes in allele frequencies, or the extent of linkage disequilibrium (LD) between unlinked markers. We applied these approaches to estimate contemporary N-e of a relatively recently founded island population of collared flycatchers (Ficedula albicollis). We sequenced the genomes of 85 birds sampled in 1993 and 2015, and applied several temporal methods to estimate N-e at a few thousand (4000-7000). The approach based on LD provided higher estimates of N-e (20,000-32,000) and was associated with high variance, often resulting in infinite N-e. We conclude that whole-genome sequencing data offers new possibilities to estimate high (>1000) contemporary N-e, but also note that such estimates remain challenging, in particular for LD-based methods for contemporary N-e estimation.","[Nadachowska-Brzyska, Krystyna; Dutoit, Ludovic; Smeds, Linnea; Ellegren, Hans] Uppsala Univ, Evolutionary Biol Ctr, Dept Evolutionary Biol, Norbyvagen 18D, SE-75236 Uppsala, Sweden; [Nadachowska-Brzyska, Krystyna] Jagiellonian Univ, Inst Environm Sci, Krakow, Poland; [Smeds, Linnea] Univ Otago, Dept Zool, Dunedin, New Zealand; [Kardos, Martin] NOAA, Northwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Seattle, WA USA; [Gustafsson, Lars] Uppsala Univ, Evolutionary Biol Ctr, Dept Anim Ecol, Uppsala, Sweden","Uppsala University; Jagiellonian University; University of Otago; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Uppsala University","Nadachowska-Brzyska, K (corresponding author), Uppsala Univ, Evolutionary Biol Ctr, Dept Evolutionary Biol, Norbyvagen 18D, SE-75236 Uppsala, Sweden.","krystyna.nadachowska@uj.edu.pl","Gustafsson, Lars/O-8056-2019; Nadachowska-Brzyska, Krystyna/ABB-7632-2020; Gustafsson, Lars/A-7634-2012","Gustafsson, Lars/0000-0001-6566-2863; Smeds, Linnea/0000-0002-8415-9259; Dutoit, Ludovic/0000-0002-0164-9878; Nadachowska-Brzyska, Krystyna/0000-0002-8457-310X","Vetenskapsradet; Knut och Alice Wallenbergs Stiftelse","Vetenskapsradet(Swedish Research Council); Knut och Alice Wallenbergs Stiftelse(Knut & Alice Wallenberg Foundation)","Vetenskapsradet; Knut och Alice Wallenbergs Stiftelse",NA,61,14,14,1,23,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","0962-1083","1365-294X","","MOL ECOL","Mol.

However, genetic structure can exist naturally at small scales through processes other than isolation by physical barriers. We sampled individuals from five native fish species with varying life histories above and below a dam in the lower Boardman River, Michigan, USA, and used RADseq to investigate processes influencing genetic structure in this system. Species assessed were white sucker Catostomus commersonii, yellow perch Perca flavescens, walleye Sander vitreus, smallmouth bass Micropterus dolomieu, and rock bass Ambloplites rupestris. We detected significant differentiation within each species, but patterns of population structure varied substantially. Interestingly, genetic structure did not appear to be solely the result of fragmentation by the dam. While genetic structure in yellow perch and walleye generally coincided with above dam and below dam sampling locations, samples from our other three species did not. Specifically, samples from rock bass, smallmouth bass, and, to a much lesser extent, white sucker, aligned with a putative Great Lakes (GL) group that contained mostly individuals sampled below the dam and a putative Boardman River (BR) group that contained individuals sampled both above and below the dam, with some evidence of admixture among groups. We hypothesize that the GL and BR groups formed prior to dam construction and our samples largely represent a mixed stock that was sampled sympatrically outside of the spawning season. Support for this hypothesis is especially strong in smallmouth bass, where GL fish were 151 mm smaller than BR fish on average, suggesting a potential ontogenetic habitat shift of young GL fish into the lower river for feeding and/or refuge. Our study illuminates the complex dynamics shaping genetic structure in fragmented river systems and indicates that conclusions drawn for a single species cannot be generalized.","[Gehri, Rebecca R.] Univ Wisconsin Stevens Point, Coll Nat Resources, Wisconsin Cooperat Fishery Res Unit, 800 Reserve St, Stevens Point, WI 54481 USA; [Gruenthal, Kristen] Univ Wisconsin Stevens Point, Wisconsin Dept Nat Resources, Coll Nat Resources, Off Appl Sci, Stevens Point, WI USA; [Gruenthal, Kristen] Alaska Dept Fish & Game, Gene Conservat Lab, Juneau, AK USA; [Larson, Wesley A.] Univ Wisconsin Stevens Point, Coll Nat Resources, Wisconsin Cooperat Fishery Res Unit, US Geol Survey, Stevens Point, WI USA; [Larson, Wesley A.] NOAA, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Alaska Fisheries Sci Ctr, Auke Bay Labs, Juneau, AK USA","University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Stevens Point; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Stevens Point; Alaska Department of Fish & Game; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Stevens Point; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)","Gehri, RR (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin Stevens Point, Coll Nat Resources, Wisconsin Cooperat Fishery Res Unit, 800 Reserve St, Stevens Point, WI 54481 USA.","gehrir@gmail.com","","Gehri, Rebecca/0000-0003-0679-414X; Larson, Wesley/0000-0003-4473-3401","Great Lakes Fishery Commission; Great Lakes Restoration Initiative","Great Lakes Fishery Commission; Great Lakes Restoration Initiative","Great Lakes Fishery Commission; Great Lakes Restoration Initiative",NA,105,4,5,4,23,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","1752-4571","","","EVOL APPL","Evol.

These lesions are increasingly found throughout the tropics and are commonly associated with high human population density, yet little is known about the molecular pathology of the disease. Here, we investigate the metabolic impacts of GAs through H-1 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) metabolomics in Porites compressa tissues from a site of high disease prevalence (Coconut Island, Hawaii). We putatively identified 18 metabolites (8.1% of total annotated features) through complementary H-1 and H-1-C-13 heteronuclear single quantum correlation NMR data that increase confidence in pathway analyses and may bolster future coral metabolite annotation efforts. Extract yield was elevated in both GA and unaffected (normal tissue from a diseased colony) compared to reference (normal tissue from GA-free colony) samples, potentially indicating elevated metabolic activity in GA-impacted colonies. Relatively high variation in metabolomic profiles among coral samples of the same treatment (i.e., inter-colony variation) confounded data interpretation, however, analyses of paired GA and unaffected samples identified 73 features that differed between these respective metabolome types. These features were largely annotated as unknowns, but 1-methylnicotinamide and trigonelline were found to be elevated in GA samples, while betaine, glycine, and histamine were lower in GA samples. Pathway analyses indicate decreased choline oxidation in GA samples, making this a pathway of interest for future targeted studies. Collectively, our results provide unique insights into GA pathophysiology by showing these lesions alter both the absolute and relative metabolism of affected colonies and by identifying features (metabolites and unknowns) and metabolic pathways of interest in GA pathophysiology going forward.","[Andersson, Erik R.; Day, Rusty D.] Coll Charleston, Dept Biol, Grice Marine Lab, 205 Ft Johnson Rd, Charleston, SC 29412 USA; [Andersson, Erik R.; Day, Rusty D.; Schock, Tracey B.] NIST, Chem Sci Div, Hollings Marine Lab, Charleston, SC 29412 USA; [Day, Rusty D.] Marine Sci & Naut Training Acad MANTA, 417 Planters Trace Dr, Charleston, SC 29412 USA; [Work, Thierry M.] US Geol Survey, Natl Wildlife Hlth Ctr, Honolulu Field Stn, Honolulu, HI 96850 USA; [Anderson, Paul E.] Calif Polytech State Univ San Luis Obispo, Dept Comp Sci & Software Engn, San Luis Obispo, CA 93407 USA; [Woodley, Cheryl M.] Natl Ocean Serv, NOAA, Natl Ctr Coastal Ocean Sci, Hollings Marine Lab, Charleston, SC 29412 USA","College of Charleston; National Institute of Standards & Technology (NIST) - USA; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; California State University System; California Polytechnic State University San Luis Obispo; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; National Ocean Service, NOAA; National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science (NOOCS)","Andersson, ER (corresponding author), Coll Charleston, Dept Biol, Grice Marine Lab, 205 Ft Johnson Rd, Charleston, SC 29412 USA.;Andersson, ER (corresponding author), NIST, Chem Sci Div, Hollings Marine Lab, Charleston, SC 29412 USA.","anderssoner@g.cofc.edu","Work, Thierry/F-1550-2015","Andersson, Erik/0000-0002-7968-7057","","","",NA,86,8,9,0,10,"SPRINGER","NEW YORK","ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES","0722-4028","1432-0975","","CORAL REEFS","Coral Reefs","AUG",2021,40,"4",NA,"","","",1195,1209,"","10.1007/s00338-021-02125-7","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00338-021-02125-7",NA,"JUN 2021",15,"Marine & Freshwater Biology","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Marine & Freshwater Biology","TP8HR",NA,"","","","2024-10-25","WOS:000660789300001","View Full Record in Web of Science",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Until recently, quantification of the degree of climate specialization in migratory birds below the species level was hindered by a lack of genomic and tracking information, but recent technological advances have helped to overcome these barriers. Here we take a genome-wide genetic approach to mapping population-specific migratory routes and quantifying niche breadth within genetically distinct populations of a migratory bird, the willow flycatcher (Empidonax traillii), which exhibits variation in the severity of population declines across its breeding range. While our sample size is restricted to the number of genetically distinct populations within the species, our results support the idea that locally adapted populations of the willow flycatcher with narrow climatic niches across seasons are already federally listed as endangered or in steep decline, while populations with broader climatic niches have remained stable in recent decades. Overall, this work highlights the value of quantifying niche breadth within genetically distinct groups across time and space when attempting to understand the factors that facilitate or constrain the response of locally adapted populations to rapid environmental change.","[Ruegg, Kristen; Somveille, Marius] Colorado State Univ, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Anderson, Eric C.] Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Southwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Santa Cruz, CA USA; [Bay, Rachael A.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Evolut & Ecol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Whitfield, Mary] Southern Sierra Res Stn, Weldon, CA USA; [Paxton, Eben H.] US Geol Survey, Pacific Isl Ecosyst Res Ctr, Hawaii Natl Pk, Hilo, HI USA; [Smith, Thomas B.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Smith, Thomas B.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Inst Environm & Sustainabil, Los Angeles, CA USA","Colorado State University; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of California System; University of California Davis; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles","Ruegg, K (corresponding author), Colorado State Univ, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.","Kristen.ruegg@colostate.edu","Whitfield, Mary/ACW-0716-2022; , Tom Smtih/JXX-5281-2024","Ruegg, Kristen/0000-0001-5579-941X","National Geographic Society [WW-202R-170]; California Energy Commission [EPC-15-043]; NSF [1942313, 1837940, ACI-1548562]; NMBCA [6335, 6754]; Direct For Biological Sciences [1837940] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Direct For Biological Sciences; Division Of Environmental Biology [1942313] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Division Of Integrative Organismal Systems [1837940] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","National Geographic Society(National Geographic Society); California Energy Commission; NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NMBCA; Direct For Biological Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)); Direct For Biological Sciences; Division Of Environmental Biology(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)); Division Of Integrative Organismal Systems(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)NSF - Division of Integrative Organismal Systems (IOS))","National Geographic Society, Grant/Award Number: WW-202R-170; California Energy Commission, Grant/Award Number: EPC-15-043; NSF, Grant/Award Number: 1942313, 1837940 and ACI-1548562; NMBCA, Grant/Award Number: 6335 and 6754",NA,62,11,14,1,34,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","1354-1013","1365-2486","","GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL","Glob.

Because they build tubes and act as ecosystem engineers, they can have a large impact on the overall ecosystem in which they occur. One conspicuous member, Diopatra biscayensis, which was only described in 2012, has a fragmented distribution that includes the Bay of Biscay and the Normanno-Breton Gulf in the English Channel. This study explores the origin of these worms in the Normanno-Breton region, which has been debated to either be the result of a historic range contraction from a relic continuous population or a more recent introduction. Location Northeastern Atlantic, the Bay of Biscay, and the Normanno-Breton Gulf. Methods We utilized a RAD-tag-based SNP approach to create a reduced genomic data set to recover fine-scale population structure and infer which hypothesis best describes the D. biscayensis biogeographic distribution. The reduced genomic data set was used to calculate standard genetic diversities and genetic differentiation statistics, and utilized various clustering analyses, including PCAs, DAPC, and admixture. Results Clustering analyses were consistent with D. biscayensis as a single population spanning the Bay of Biscay to the Normanno-Breton Gulf in the English Channel, although unexpected genetic substructure was recovered from Arcachon Bay, in the middle of its geographic range. Consistent with a hypothesized introduction, the isolated Sainte-Anne locality in the Normanno-Breton Gulf was recovered to be a subset of the diversity found in the rest of the Bay of Biscay. Main conclusions These results are congruent with previous simulations that did not support connectivity from the Bay of Biscay to the Normanno-Breton Gulf by natural dispersal. These genomic findings, with support from previous climatic studies, further support the hypothesis that D. biscayensis phylogeographic connectivity is the result of introductions, likely through the regions' rich shellfish aquaculture, and not of a historically held range contraction.","[Galaska, Matthew P.] Univ Washington, Cooperat Inst Climate Ocean & Ecosyst Studies, NOAA, Pacific Marine Environm Lab, Seattle, WA 98115 USA; [Galaska, Matthew P.; Halanych, Kenneth M.] Auburn Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Auburn, AL USA; [Wethey, David S.; Woodin, Sarah A.] Univ South Carolina, Dept Biol Sci, Columbia, SC 29208 USA; [Arias, Andres] Univ Oviedo, Dept Biol Organismos & Sistemas Zool, Oviedo, Spain; [Dubois, Stanislas F.] IFREMER DYNECO LEBCO, Plouzane, France","University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Auburn University System; Auburn University; University of South Carolina System; University of South Carolina Columbia; University of Oviedo; Ifremer","Galaska, MP (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Cooperat Inst Climate Ocean & Ecosyst Studies, Seattle, WA 98115 USA.;Galaska, MP (corresponding author), NOAA, Pacific Marine Environm Lab, Seattle, WA 98115 USA.","matt.galaska@noaa.gov","Galaska, Mathew/L-3948-2019; Dubois, Stanislas/F-2939-2010; Woodin, Sarah/K-8481-2014; Halanych, Kenneth/A-9480-2009; Arias, Andres/AAA-4720-2019; Wethey, David/K-8063-2014","Woodin, Sarah/0000-0001-5615-2212; Dubois, Stanislas/0000-0002-3326-4892; Galaska, Matthew/0000-0002-4257-0170; Halanych, Kenneth/0000-0002-8658-9674; Arias, Andres/0000-0002-1364-7204; Wethey, David/0000-0002-2549-1606","NASA; NSF; JISAO/PMEL","NASA(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)); NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); JISAO/PMEL","NASA and NSF grant awards; JISAO/PMEL",NA,64,3,4,0,5,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","2045-7758","","","ECOL EVOL","Ecol.

The heritability (h(2)) of selected traits has long been known to affect evolutionary and demographic responses to environmental change. However, effects of the genetic architecture underlying the h(2) of a selected trait on population responses to selection are less well understood. We use deterministic models and stochastic simulations to show that the genetic architecture underlying h(2) can dramatically affect population viability during environmental change. Polygenic trait architectures (many loci, each with a small phenotypic effect) conferred higher population viability than genetic architectures with the same initial h(2) and large-effect loci under a wide range of scenarios. Population viability also depended strongly on the initial frequency of large-effect beneficial alleles, with moderately low initial allele frequencies conferring higher viability than rare or already-frequent large-effect alleles. Greater population viability associated with polygenic architectures appears to be due to higher short-term evolutionary potential compared with architectures with large-effect loci. These results suggest that integrating information on the trait genetic architecture into quantitative genetic and population viability analysis will substantially improve our understanding and prediction of evolutionary and demographic responses following environmental change.","[Kardos, Marty] Natl Ocean & Atmospher Adm, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Northwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Seattle, WA 98112 USA; [Luikart, Gordon] Univ Montana, Div Biol Sci, Flathead Lake Biol Stn, Polson, MT 59860 USA","National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of Montana System; University of Montana","Kardos, M (corresponding author), Natl Ocean & Atmospher Adm, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Northwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Seattle, WA 98112 USA.","martin.kardos@noaa.gov","luikart, gordon/L-8888-2013","","Montana Fish, Wildlife, and Parks; National Science Foundation [DoB-1639014]; National Aeronautics and Space Administration [NNX14AB84G]","Montana Fish, Wildlife, and Parks; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); National Aeronautics and Space Administration(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA))","M.K. was supported by Montana Fish, Wildlife, and Parks.

Thus, there is an increasing need for conservation geneticists to continually learn and train to stay up-to-date through avenues such as symposia, meetings, and workshops. The ConGen meeting is a near-annual workshop that strives to guide participants in understanding population genetics principles, study design, data processing, analysis, interpretation, and applications to real-world conservation issues. Each year of ConGen gathers a diverse set of instructors, students, and resulting lectures, hands-on sessions, and discussions. Here, we summarize key lessons learned from the 2019 meeting and more recent updates to the field with a focus on big data in conservation genomics. First, we highlight classical and contemporary issues in study design that are especially relevant to working with big datasets, including the intricacies of data filtering. We next emphasize the importance of building analytical skills and simulating data, and how these skills have applications within and outside of conservation genetics careers. We also highlight recent technological advances and novel applications to conservation of wild populations. Finally, we provide data and recommendations to support ongoing efforts by ConGen organizers and instructors-and beyond-to increase participation of underrepresented minorities in conservation and eco-evolutionary sciences. The future success of conservation genetics requires both continual training in handling big data and a diverse group of people and approaches to tackle key issues, including the global bio-diversityloss crisis.","[Schweizer, Rena M.; Hand, Brian K.; Luikart, Gordon] Univ Montana, Div Biol Sci, 32 Campus Dr, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Saarman, Norah] Utah State Univ, Dept Biol, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Ramstad, Kristina M.] Univ South Carolina, Dept Biol & Geol, Aiken, SC USA; [Forester, Brenna R.] Colorado State Univ, Dept Biol, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Kelley, Joanna L.] Washington State Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Pullman, WA USA; [Hand, Brian K.; Malison, Rachel L.; Luikart, Gordon] Univ Montana, Flathead Lake Biol Stn, Poison, MT USA; [Ackiss, Amanda S.] Univ Wisconsin, Wisconsin Cooperat Fishery Res Unit, Stevens Point, WI 54481 USA; [Watsa, Mrinalini] San Diego Zoo Global, Escondido, CA USA; [Nelson, Thomas C.] Embark Vet Inc, Boston, MA USA; [Beja-Pereira, Albano] Univ Porto, Ctr Invest Biodiversidade & Recursos Genet CIBIO, InBIO, Vairgo, Portugal; [Beja-Pereira, Albano] Univ Porto, Fac Sci, DGAOT, Porto, Portugal; [Beja-Pereira, Albano] Univ Porto, Fac Sci, Sustainable Agrifood Prod Res Ctr GreenUPorto, Porto, Portugal; [Waples, Robin S.] NOAA Fisheries, Northwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Seattle, WA USA; [Funk, W.

We analyzed an opportunistic sample of seven adult steelhead from a small basin on the Big Sur coast of California to determine their life history traits, including whether they were strays. Otolith natural tags (Sr-87/Sr-86) and genetic stock identification indicated that all seven adults were strays from at least six different sources. Three adults strayed from nearby streams (<72 km) on the Big Sur coast, while three strayed from distant sources, including the Klamath River (680 km to the north); the source of one stray could not be identified. Six strays were progeny of steelhead mothers, but one was the offspring of a nonanadromous mother. Six were female and one was male, and all that could be genotyped were homozygous (n = 4) or heterozygous (n = 2) for the anadromy-associated haplotype in a migration-associated genomic region. While the opportunistic nature and small size of the sample prevents us from inferring the rate of straying into the basin, our study nonetheless demonstrates that steelhead may stray across greater distances than generally has been appreciated and that nonanadromous females can produce anadromous offspring that stray, thus providing connectivity among basins.","[Donohoe, Christopher J.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Inst Marine Sci, 115 McAllister Way, Santa Cruz, CA 95060 USA; [Donohoe, Christopher J.; Rundio, David E.; Pearse, Devon E.; Williams, Thomas H.] Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, NOAA, Fisheries Ecol Div, Southwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, 110 McAllister Way, Santa Cruz, CA 95060 USA; [Donohoe, Christopher J.] 610 Cabrillo Ave, Santa Cruz, CA 95065 USA","University of California System; University of California Santa Cruz; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA","Rundio, DE (corresponding author), Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, NOAA, Fisheries Ecol Div, Southwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, 110 McAllister Way, Santa Cruz, CA 95060 USA.","dave.rundio@noaa.gov","","Rundio, David/0000-0002-9881-2626","U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, National Marine Fisheries Service","U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, National Marine Fisheries Service","We are grateful to many people for help collecting samples, especially Heidi Fish, Kerrie Pipal, and Mark Jessop, and to Carlos Garza, Cassondra Columbus, Ellen Campbell, and Diana Baetscher of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Southwest Fisheries Science Center's Molecular Ecology Team for assistance generating and analyzing the genetic data.

However, the extent to which interspecific life-history trait polymorphisms share evolutionary pathways remains underexplored. Here, we address this gap by studying the genetic basis of a key life-history trait, age at maturity, in four species of Pacific salmonids (genus Oncorhynchus) that exhibit intra- and interspecific variation in this trait-Chinook Salmon, Coho Salmon, Sockeye Salmon, and Steelhead Trout. We tested for associations in all four species between age at maturity and two genome regions, six6 and vgll3, that are strongly associated with the same trait in Atlantic Salmon (Salmo salar). We also conducted a genome-wide association analysis in Steelhead to assess whether additional regions were associated with this trait. We found the genetic basis of age at maturity to be heterogeneous across salmonid species. Significant associations between six6 and age at maturity were observed in two of the four species, Sockeye and Steelhead, with the association in Steelhead being particularly strong in both sexes (p = 4.46 x 10(-9) after adjusting for genomic inflation). However, no significant associations were detected between age at maturity and the vgll3 genome region in any of the species, despite its strong association with the same trait in Atlantic Salmon. We discuss possible explanations for the heterogeneous nature of the genetic architecture of this key life-history trait, as well as the implications of our findings for conservation and management.","[Waters, Charles D.; Naish, Kerry A.] Univ Washington, Sch Aquat & Fishery Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Clemento, Anthony; Garza, John Carlos] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Inst Marine Sci, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Clemento, Anthony; Garza, John Carlos] NOAA, Santa Cruz Lab, Southwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Santa Cruz, CA USA; [Aykanat, Tutku; Primmer, Craig R.] Univ Helsinki, Organismal & Evolutionary Biol Res Programme, Helsinki, Finland; [Narum, Shawn] Columbia River Intertribal Fish Commiss, Hagerman Genet Lab, Hagerman, ID USA; [Primmer, Craig R.] Univ Helsinki, Inst Biotechnol, Helsinki, Finland; [Waters, Charles D.] NOAA, Auke Bay Labs, Alaska Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Juneau, AK 99801 USA","University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; University of California System; University of California Santa Cruz; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of Helsinki; University of Helsinki; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA","Waters, CD (corresponding author), NOAA, Auke Bay Labs, Alaska Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Juneau, AK 99801 USA.","charlie.waters@noaa.gov","Naish, Kerry-Ann/F-5768-2014; Primmer, Craig/B-8179-2008","Naish, Kerry-Ann/0000-0002-3275-8778; Primmer, Craig/0000-0002-3687-8435","","","",NA,141,25,27,0,23,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","0962-1083","1365-294X","","MOL ECOL","Mol.

Walleye (Sander vitreus) are a highly valued sportfish in the midwestern United States, a region characterized by postglacial recolonization from multiple lineages and an extensive history of stocking. We leveraged genomic data and recently developed analytical approaches to explore the population structure of walleye from two midwestern states, Minnesota and Wisconsin. We genotyped 954 walleye from 23 populations at similar to 20,000 loci using genotyping by sequencing and tested for patterns of population structure with single-SNP and microhaplotype data. Populations from Minnesota and Wisconsin were highly differentiated from each other, with additional substructure found in each state. Population structure did not consistently adhere to drainage boundaries, as cases of high intra-drainage and low inter-drainage differentiation were observed. Low genetic structure was observed between populations from the upper Wisconsin and upper Chippewa river watersheds, which are found as few as 50 km apart and were likely homogenized through historical stocking. Nevertheless, we were able to differentiate these populations using microhaplotype-based co-ancestry analysis, providing increased resolution over previous microsatellite studies and our other single SNP-based analyses. Although our results illustrate that walleye population structure has been influenced by past stocking practices, native ancestry still exists in most populations and walleye populations may be able to purge non-native alleles and haplotypes in the absence of stocking. Our study is one of the first to use genomic tools to investigate the influence of stocking on population structure in a nonsalmonid fish and outlines a workflow leveraging recently developed analytical methods to improve resolution of complex population structure that will be highly applicable in many species and systems.","[Bootsma, Matthew L.; Euclide, Peter T.] Univ Wisconsin, Coll Nat Resources, Wisconsin Cooperat Fishery Res Unit, 800 Reserve St, Stevens Point, WI 54481 USA; [Miller, Loren] Univ Minnesota, Minnesota Dept Nat Resources, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Sass, Greg G.] Escanaba Lake Res Stn, Wisconsin Dept Nat Resources, Off Appl Sci, Boulder Jct, WI USA; [Larson, Wesley A.] Univ Wisconsin, Coll Nat Resources, Wisconsin Cooperat Fishery Res Unit, US Geol Survey, Stevens Point, WI 54481 USA; [Larson, Wesley A.] NOAA, Ted Stevens Marine Res Inst, Alaska Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Juneau, AK USA","University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Stevens Point; Minnesota Department of Natural Resources; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Stevens Point; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA","Bootsma, ML (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Coll Nat Resources, Wisconsin Cooperat Fishery Res Unit, 800 Reserve St, Stevens Point, WI 54481 USA.","mbootsma@uwsp.edu","","Euclide, Peter/0000-0002-1212-0435; Bootsma, Matthew/0000-0003-0879-5066","United States Fish and Wildlife Service, Federal Aid in Sportfish Restoration program","United States Fish and Wildlife Service, Federal Aid in Sportfish Restoration program","United States Fish and Wildlife Service, Federal Aid in Sportfish Restoration program",NA,115,15,18,2,16,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","1752-4571","","","EVOL APPL","Evol.

The data show that the metabolome patterns for fish from the two WWTP-receiving estuaries were more similar to each other compared to that for the reference site fish. Also, a comparison of the metabolome for fish from the reference site and fish from a hatchery upstream of one of the effluent-receiving estuaries indicated no differences, implying that residency for fish in the contaminated estuary resulted in major changes to the metabolome. Based on general health parameters including whole-body lipid content and condition factor, plus the availability of prey for these fish, we conclude that juvenile Chinook salmon in these contaminated estuaries may have been experiencing metabolic disruption without any overt signs of impairment. Additionally, a non-targeted analysis was performed on hatchery summer Chinook salmon from a laboratory study where fish were dosed for 32 days with feed containing 16 of the most common contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) detected in wild fish. In the laboratory experiment a relationship was observed between dose and the number of liver metabolites that were different between control and treatment fish. Laboratory fish were exposed to only 16 CECs, but are generally exposed to hundreds of these compounds in contaminated aquatic environments. These results have implications for the health of juvenile Chinook salmon and the likelihood of a successful life cycle when exposed to effluent-related chemicals.

Despite major conservation issues among porpoise species (e.g., vaquita and finless), their evolutionary history remains understudied. Here, we reconstructed their evolutionary history across the speciation continuum. Phylogenetic analyses of 63 mitochondrial genomes suggest that porpoises radiated during the deep environmental changes of the Pliocene. However, all intra-specific subdivisions were shaped during the Quaternary glaciations. We observed analogous evolutionary patterns in both hemispheres associated with convergent evolution to coastal versus oceanic environments. This suggests that similar mechanisms are driving species diversification in northern (harbor and Dall's) and southern species (spectacled and Burmeister's). In contrast to previous studies, spectacled and Burmeister's porpoises shared a more recent common ancestor than with the vaquita that diverged from southern species during the Pliocene. The low genetic diversity observed in the vaquita carried signatures of a very low population size since the last 5,000 years. Cryptic lineages within Dall's, spectacled and Pacific harbor porpoises suggest a richer evolutionary history than previously suspected. These results provide a new perspective on the mechanisms driving diversification in porpoises and an evolutionary framework for their conservation.","[Ben Chehida, Yacine; Thumloup, Julie; Fontaine, Michael C.] Univ Groningen, Groningen Inst Evolutionary Life Sci GELIFES, POB 11103 CC, Groningen, Netherlands; [Schumacher, Cassie; Harkins, Timothy] Swift Biosci, 674 S Wagner Rd,Suite 100, Ann Arbor, MI 48103 USA; [Aguilar, Alex; Borrell, Asuncion] Univ Barcelona, IRBIO, Fac Biol, Diagonal 643, Barcelona 08071, Spain; [Aguilar, Alex; Borrell, Asuncion] Univ Barcelona, Dept Evolut Biol Ecol & Environm Sci, Fac Biol, Diagonal 643, Barcelona 08071, Spain; [Ferreira, Marisa] MATB Soc Portuguesa Vida Selvagem, Estacao Campo Quiaios, Apartado EC Quiaios, P-3080530 Figueira Da Foz, Portugal; [Ferreira, Marisa] CPRAM Ecomare, Estr Porto Pesca Costeira, P-3830565 Gafanha Da Nazare, Portugal; [Rojas-Bracho, Lorenzo] Comis Nacl Areas Nat Protegidas CONANP, Ctr Invest Cient & Educ Super Ensenada, Carretera Ensenada Tijuana 3918, Ensenada 22860, BC, Mexico; [Robertson, Kelly M.; Taylor, Barbara L.; Morin, Phillip A.] NOAA, Southwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, 8901 La Jolla Shores Dr, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Vikingsson, Gisli A.] Marine & Freshwater Res Inst, Fornubudum 5, IS-220 Hafnarfjordur, Iceland; [Weyna, Arthur; Romiguier, Jonathan] Univ Montpellier, Inst Sci Evolut, CNRS UMR 5554, Montpellier, France; [Fontaine, Michael C.] Univ Montpellier, Lab MIVEGEC, CNRS 5290, IRD 229, 911 Ave Agropolis,BP 64501, F-34394 Montpellier, France; [Fontaine, Michael C.] Inst Rech Dev IRD, Ctr Rech Ecol & Evolut Sante CREES, 911 Ave Agropolis,BP 64501, F-34394 Montpellier, France","University of Groningen; University of Barcelona; University of Barcelona; CICESE - Centro de Investigacion Cientifica y de Educacion Superior de Ensenada; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Marine & Freshwater Research Institute (MFRI); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Universite de Montpellier; CNRS - Institute of Ecology & Environment (INEE); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Universite de Montpellier; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Universite de Montpellier","Fontaine, MC (corresponding author), Univ Groningen, Groningen Inst Evolutionary Life Sci GELIFES, POB 11103 CC, Groningen, Netherlands.;Fontaine, MC (corresponding author), Univ Montpellier, Lab MIVEGEC, CNRS 5290, IRD 229, 911 Ave Agropolis,BP 64501, F-34394 Montpellier, France.;Fontaine, MC (corresponding author), Inst Rech Dev IRD, Ctr Rech Ecol & Evolut Sante CREES, 911 Ave Agropolis,BP 64501, F-34394 Montpellier, France.","michael.fontaine@cnrs.fr","Fontaine, Michael/G-5350-2011; Morin, Phillip/E-9515-2010; Borrell, Asuncion/B-8257-2009; Aguilar, Alex/L-1283-2014","Ben Chehida, Hedi Yacine/0000-0001-7269-9082; Borrell, Asuncion/0000-0002-6714-0724; Aguilar, Alex/0000-0002-5751-2512","Center for Information Technology of the University of Groningen; University of Groningen (The Netherlands); University of Groningen; Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT) [SFRH/BD/30240/2006]","Center for Information Technology of the University of Groningen; University of Groningen (The Netherlands)(Netherlands Government); University of Groningen; Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT)(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT))","The following persons deserve our special thanks for having collected and made the samples available for this study: Tom Jefferson, Carlos Olavarria, Jay Barlow, Robin Baird, Marilyn Dahlheim, Lorenzo Rojas-Bracho.

However, the dynamics of fish populations are highly complex, and phenotypes can be influenced by many biotic and abiotic factors. Therefore, it is vital to collect robust data and explore multiple alternative hypotheses before concluding that fish populations are influenced by harvest. In their recently published manuscript, Bowles et al, Evolutionary Applications, 13(6):1128 conducted age/growth and genomic analysis of walleye (Sander vitreus) populations sampled 13-15 years (1-2.5 generations) apart and hypothesized that observed phenotypic and genomic changes in this time period were likely due to harvest. Specifically, Bowles et al. (2020) documented differential declines in size-at-age in three exploited walleye populations compared to a separate, but presumably less-exploited, reference population. Additionally, they documented population genetic differentiation in one population pair, homogenization in another, and outlier loci putatively under selection across time points. Based on their phenotypic and genetic results, they hypothesized that selective harvest had led to fisheries-induced evolution (referred to as nascent changes) in the exploited populations in as little as 1-2.5 generations. We re-analyzed their data and found that (a) sizes declined across both exploited and reference populations during the time period studied and (b) observed genomic differentiation in their study was the result of inadequate data filtering, including retaining individuals with high amounts of missing data and retaining potentially undersplit and oversplit loci that created false signals of differentiation between time points. This re-analysis did not provide evidence for phenotypic or genetic changes attributable to harvest in any of the study populations, contrasting the hypotheses presented by Bowles et al. (2020). Our comment highlights the potential pitfalls associated with conducting age/growth analyses with low sample sizes and inadequately filtering genomic datasets.","[Larson, Wesley A.] NOAA, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Alaska Fisheries Sci Ctr, Auke Bay Labs, 17109 Point Lena Loop Rd, Juneau, AK 99801 USA; [Isermann, Daniel A.] Univ Wisconsin Stevens Point, Coll Nat Resources, Wisconsin Cooperat Fishery Res Unit, US Geol Survey, Stevens Point, WI USA; [Feiner, Zachary S.] Wisconsin Dept Nat Resources, Off Appl Sci, Sci Operat Ctr, Madison, WI USA","National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Stevens Point; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey","Larson, WA (corresponding author), NOAA, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Alaska Fisheries Sci Ctr, Auke Bay Labs, 17109 Point Lena Loop Rd, Juneau, AK 99801 USA.","wes.larson@noaa.gov","Feiner, Zachary/A-2117-2009","Feiner, Zachary/0000-0001-7880-0778; Larson, Wesley/0000-0003-4473-3401","","","",NA,36,16,16,0,8,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","1752-4571","","","EVOL APPL","Evol.

This has been linked to the oceanographically unique nature of Nanwan Bay, where intense upwelling occurs. Specifically, large-amplitude internal waves cause shifts in temperature of 6-9 degrees C over the course of several hours, and the resident corals not only thrive under such conditions, but they have also been shown to withstand multi-month laboratory incubations at experimentally elevated temperatures. To gain insight into the sub-cellular basis of acclimation to upwelling, proteins isolated from reef corals (Seriatopora hystrix) featured in laboratory-based reciprocal transplant studies in which corals from upwelling and non-upwelling control reefs (<20 km away) were exposed to stable or variable temperature regimes were analyzed via label-based proteomics (iTRAQ). Corals exposed to their native temperature conditions for seven days (1) demonstrated highest growth rates and (2) were most distinct from one another with respect to their protein signatures. The latter observation was driven by the fact that two Symbiodiniaceae lipid trafficking proteins, sec1a and sec34, were marginally up-regulated in corals exposed to their native temperature conditions. Alongside the marked degree of proteomic site fidelity documented, this dataset sheds light on the molecular mechanisms underlying acclimatization to thermodynamically extreme conditions in situ.","[Mayfield, Anderson B.] NOAA, Atlantic Oceanog & Meteorol Lab, 4301 Rickenbacker Causeway, Miami, FL 33149 USA; [Mayfield, Anderson B.] Univ Miami, Cooperat Inst Marine & Atmospher Studies, 4300 Rickenbacker Causeway, Miami, FL 33149 USA","National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Atlantic Oceanographic & Meteorological Laboratory (AOML); University of Miami","Mayfield, AB (corresponding author), NOAA, Atlantic Oceanog & Meteorol Lab, 4301 Rickenbacker Causeway, Miami, FL 33149 USA.;Mayfield, AB (corresponding author), Univ Miami, Cooperat Inst Marine & Atmospher Studies, 4300 Rickenbacker Causeway, Miami, FL 33149 USA.","abm64@miami.edu","","Mayfield, Anderson/0000-0003-0138-7844","National Science Foundation [OISE-0852960]; Khaled bin Sultan Living Oceans Foundation; Fulbright program; MacArthur Foundation","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Khaled bin Sultan Living Oceans Foundation; Fulbright program; MacArthur Foundation","This work would not have been possible without funds from the National Science Foundation (OISE-0852960), the Khaled bin Sultan Living Oceans Foundation, the Fulbright program, and the MacArthur Foundation.

However, estimating N-b is difficult in age-structured populations because the performance of estimators is influenced by the N-b / N-e ratio, which varies among species with different life histories. We provide a computer program, AgeStrucNb, to simulate age-structured populations (including life history) and also estimate N-b. The AgeStrucNb program is composed of 4 major components to simulate, subsample, estimate, and then visualize N-b time series data. AgeStrucNb allows users to also quantify the precision and accuracy of any set of loci or sample size to estimate N-b for many species and populations. AgeStrucNb allows users to conduct power analysis to evaluate sensitivity to detect changes in N-b or the power to detect a correlation between trends in N-b and environmental variables (e.g., temperature, habitat quality, predator or pathogen abundance) that could be driving changes in N-b. The software provides N-b estimates for empirical data sets using the LDNe (linkage disequilibrium) method, includes publication-quality output graphs, and outputs genotype files in Genepop format for use in other programs. AgeStrucNb will help advance the application of genetic markers for monitoring N-b, which will help biologists to detect population declines and growth, which is crucial for research and conservation of natural and managed populations.","[Antao, Tiago; Luikart, Gordon; Hand, Brian K.] Univ Montana, Div Biol Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Cosart, Ted; Luikart, Gordon; Hand, Brian K.] Univ Montana, Flathead Lake Biol Stn, Polson, MT 59860 USA; [Trethewey, Brian] Univ Montana, Comp Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Waples, Robin S.] NOAA, Fisheries, Northwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Seattle, WA USA; [Ackerman, Mike W.] Biomark, Appl Biol Serv, 705 S 8th St, Boise, ID 83702 USA","University of Montana System; University of Montana; University of Montana System; University of Montana; University of Montana System; University of Montana; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA","Hand, BK (corresponding author), Flathead Lake Biol Stn, 32125 Bio Stn Ln, Polson, MT 59860 USA.","brian.hand@umontana.edu","Waples, Robin/K-1126-2016; luikart, gordon/L-8888-2013; Hand, Brian/F-9963-2014","","National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) [NNX14AB84G]; National Science Foundation [DEB-1639014]; Montana Fish Wildlife and Parks (MT-FWP)","National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Montana Fish Wildlife and Parks (MT-FWP)","National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) (NNX14AB84G) to T.C., B.T., G.L., and B.K.H.; the National Science Foundation (DEB-1639014); Montana Fish Wildlife and Parks (MT-FWP) to G.L. and B.K.H.",NA,31,3,3,0,3,"OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC","CARY","JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA","0022-1503","1465-7333","","J HERED","J.

A variety of technical and conceptual developments, particularly in the last decade have revolutionized the field of microbiology, redrawing the landscape, and entirely redefining what is possible. Perhaps this paradigm shift is no more apparent than in the study of vibrios. The family Vibrionaceae are almost unique as a group of bacteria to study in microbiology: they are genomically, phylogenetically and functionally diverse yet a distinct group of environmental bacteria encompassing important human and animal pathogens as well as non-pathogenic species such as ecologically critical symbionts. Sensitive to physiochemical stimuli, they are among the fasting replicating bacteria studied, capable of responding almost immediately to favourable environmental conditions such as those afforded by climate warming. Characterized by an unusual double chromosome and frequently carrying numerous cryptic plasmids - their genomes are often pockmarked with insertion elements, transposons, prophages and integrases - paying testament to past genomic promiscuity. With a strong affinity for environmental niches in freshwater and marine systems, they are among the most numerous bacteria present in our oceans, coasts and freshwater environments. As such they offer something for almost anyone interested in microbiology and represent an excellent example of field of microbiology that has benefitted hugely by advances across a gamut of disciplines - not just microbiological - but encompassing genomics, genetics, oceanography, ecological, earth observations sciences and data visualization, among others. We will briefly outline some of the most exciting, innovative and translational scientific advances that are currently being applied to these ecologically, environmentally and clinically important bacteria.","[Baker-Austin, Craig; Martinez-Urtaza, Jaime] Ctr Environm Fisheries & Aquaculture CEFAS, Weymouth, Dorset DT4 8UB, England; [Trinanes, Joaquin] Univ Santiago de Compostela, CRETUS, Campus Univ Sur, Santiago De Compostela 15782, Spain; [Trinanes, Joaquin] NOAA, Atlantic Oceanog & Meteorol Lab, 4301 Rickenbacker Causeway, Miami, FL 33149 USA; [Trinanes, Joaquin] Univ Miami, Cooperat Inst Marine & Atmospher Studies, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, 4600 Rickenbacker Causeway, Miami, FL 33149 USA; [Martinez-Urtaza, Jaime] Campus Univ Autonoma Barcelona UAB, Fac Biociencies, Dept Genet & Microbiol, Edif C, Barcelona 08193, Spain","Universidade de Santiago de Compostela; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Atlantic Oceanographic & Meteorological Laboratory (AOML); University of Miami; Autonomous University of Barcelona","Baker-Austin, C (corresponding author), Ctr Environm Fisheries & Aquaculture CEFAS, Weymouth, Dorset DT4 8UB, England.","craig.baker-austin@cefas.co.uk","Martinez-Urtaza, Jaime/ABG-5429-2020; Trinanes, Joaquin/B-3881-2015","Martinez-Urtaza, Jaime/0000-0001-6219-0418; Trinanes, Joaquin/0000-0003-1529-3371","","","",NA,25,7,8,0,8,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","1462-2912","1462-2920","","ENVIRON MICROBIOL","Environ.

N-e can substantially depart from census sizes of present-day breeding populations (N-C) as a result of past demographic changes, variation in life-history traits and selection at linked sites. Using genome-wide data we estimated the long-term coalescent N-e for 17 pinniped species represented by 36 population samples (total n = 458 individuals). N-e estimates ranged from 8,936 to 91,178, were highly consistent within (sub)species and showed a strong positive correlation with N-C (R-adj(2) = 0.59; P = 0.0002). N-e/N-C ratios were low (mean, 0.31; median, 0.13) and co-varied strongly with demographic history and, to a lesser degree, with species' ecological and life-history variables such as breeding habitat. Residual variation in N-e/N-C, after controlling for past demographic fluctuations, contained information about recent population size changes during the Anthropocene. Specifically, species of conservation concern typically had positive residuals indicative of a smaller contemporary N-C than would be expected from their long-term N-e. This study highlights the value of comparative population genomic analyses for gauging the evolutionary processes governing genetic variation in natural populations, and provides a framework for identifying populations deserving closer conservation attention.","[Peart, Claire R.; Tusso, Sergio; Wu, Chi-Chih; Shafer, Aaron B.

By understanding organism and ecosystem responses to environmental stressors at the molecular level, mechanisms of toxicity and adaptation can be determined. This information has important implications in human and environmental health, engineering biotechnologies, and understanding the interaction between anthropogenic induced changes and the biosphere. One class of molecules with unique promise for environmental science are lipids; lipids are highly abundant and ubiquitous across nearly all organisms, and lipid profiles often change drastically in response to external stimuli. These changes allow organisms to maintain essential biological functions, for example, membrane fluidity, as they adapt to a changing climate and chemical environment. Lipidomics can help scientists understand the historical and present biofeedback processes in climate change and the biogeochemical processes affecting nutrient cycles. Lipids can also be used to understand how ecosystems respond to historical environmental changes with lipid signatures dating back to hundreds of millions of years, which can help predict similar changes in the future. In addition, lipids are direct targets of environmental stressors, for example, lipids are easily prone to oxidative damage, which occurs during exposure to most toxins. Aim of Review This is the first review to summarize the current efforts to comprehensively measure lipids to better understand the interaction between organisms and their environment. This review focuses on lipidomic applications in the arenas of environmental toxicology and exposure assessment, xenobiotic exposures and health (e.g., obesity), global climate change, and nutrient cycles. Moreover, this review summarizes the use of and the potential for lipidomics in engineering biotechnologies for the remediation of persistent compounds and biofuel production. Key Scientific Concept With the preservation of certain lipids across millions of years and our ever-increasing understanding of their diverse biological roles, lipidomic-based approaches provide a unique utility to increase our understanding of the contemporary and historical interactions between organisms, ecosystems, and anthropogenically-induced environmental changes.","[Koelmel, Jeremy P.; Garrett, Timothy J.; Yost, Richard A.] Univ Florida, Dept Chem, 125 Buckman Dr, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Koelmel, Jeremy P.; Vasiliou, Vasilis; Pollitt, Krystal J.

We investigated the effects of temperature on the susceptibility to predation for an ectothermic intertidal mollusc (the owl limpet, Lottia gigantea) and its predator (the black oystercatcher, Haematopus bachmani). The ability of L. gigantea to resist bird predation during low tide is determined by the tenacity of attachment to the rock. We developed a transducer to measure the force of predatory attacks on limpets by a captive black oystercatcher, and tested the hypothesis that exposure to warm temperatures during low tide emersion would affect the limpet's ability to resist dislodgement in trials with a morphometrically accurate beak mimic and a live bird. In beak mimic trials, four times as many limpets exposed to warm low tides were removed, as compared with limpets exposed to cool low tides or in 'no low tide' submerged conditions. Minimum time before limpet removal in captive bird trials was more than six times longer for limpets in cool low tide or no low tide treatments compared with limpets in the warm low tide treatment. We measured shear forces up to 36.63 N during predatory strikes. These direct measurements of the forces exerted by a living oystercatcher provide context for interactions with multiple prey species. Our data suggest that naturally occurring variation in body temperatures among individual prey items in the field could be an important driver of predator-prey interactions and subsequently community patterns.","[Pound, Rachel J.; Burnaford, Jennifer L.] Calif State Univ Fullerton, Dept Biol Sci, Fullerton, CA 92834 USA; [Miller, Luke P.] San Diego State Univ, Dept Biol, San Diego, CA 92182 USA; [King, Felicia A.] Stanford Univ, Hopkins Marine Stn, Pacific Grove, CA 93950 USA; [Burnaford, Jennifer L.] Cordell Bank Natl Marine Sanctuary, Point Reyes Stn, CA 94956 USA","California State University System; California State University Fullerton; California State University System; San Diego State University; Stanford University; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA","Burnaford, JL (corresponding author), Calif State Univ Fullerton, Dept Biol Sci, Fullerton, CA 92834 USA.;Burnaford, JL (corresponding author), Cordell Bank Natl Marine Sanctuary, Point Reyes Stn, CA 94956 USA.","jbumaford@fullerton.edu","; Miller, Luke/B-8992-2009","Pound, Rachel/0000-0002-5753-923X; King, Felicia/0000-0001-6185-3822; Miller, Luke/0000-0002-2009-6981","Southern California Academy of Sciences; California State University Fullerton Associated Students Inc.; California State University Fullerton Department of Biological Science","Southern California Academy of Sciences; California State University Fullerton Associated Students Inc.; California State University Fullerton Department of Biological Science","The work was funded by student research grants from the Southern California Academy of Sciences, California State University Fullerton Associated Students Inc., and California State University Fullerton Department of Biological Science to R.J.P.",NA,57,4,4,1,43,"COMPANY BIOLOGISTS LTD","CAMBRIDGE","BIDDER BUILDING, STATION RD, HISTON, CAMBRIDGE CB24 9LF, ENGLAND","0022-0949","1477-9145","","J EXP BIOL","J.

The cephalopod species Cranchia scabra, Pyroteuthis margaritifera, and Vampyroteuthis infernalis are commonly collected in midwater samples from both the Gulf of Mexico and northwestern Atlantic Ocean but, despite their common appearance in trawls and important roles in marine food webs, no genetic studies of population connectivity exist for these species. Here, Sanger sequencing of three conserved genetic loci and ddRADseq techniques were used to examine population genetic dynamics in these deep-sea species. Genetic diversity is lowest in C. scabra, which appears to be in a population growth stage, and highest in V. infernalis. Population structure was unique to V. infernalis but does not appear to be the result of ocean-basin vicariance, thus possible alternative explanations are explored, specifically environmental variation in dissolved oxygen. The genetic connectivity between these geographically disparate sites suggests these three cephalopod species could be resilient to localized environmental disturbances in the Gulf of Mexico.","[Timm, L.

Snorkelers in mangrove forest waters inhabited by the upside-down jellyfish Cassiopea xamachana report discomfort due to a sensation known as stinging water, the cause of which is unknown. Using a combination of histology, microscopy, microfluidics, videography, molecular biology, and mass spectrometry-based proteomics, we describe C. xamachana stinging-cell structures that we term cassiosomes. These structures are released within C. xamachana mucus and are capable of killing prey. Cassiosomes consist of an outer epithelial layer mainly composed of nematocytes surrounding a core filled by endosymbiotic dinoflagellates hosted within amoebocytes and presumptive mesoglea. Furthermore, we report cassiosome structures in four additional jellyfish species in the same taxonomic group as C. xamachana (Class Scyphozoa; Order Rhizostomeae), categorized as either motile (ciliated) or nonmotile types. This inaugural study provides a qualitative assessment of the stinging contents of C. xamachana mucus and implicates mucus containing cassiosomes and free intact nematocytes as the cause of stinging water.","[Ames, Cheryl L.; Schultzhaus, Janna N.; Field, Lauren D.; Muroski, Megan E.] Natl Acad Sci, Natl Res Council, Washington, DC 20375 USA; [Ames, Cheryl L.; Schultzhaus, Janna N.; Field, Lauren D.; Muroski, Megan E.] US Naval Res Lab, Washington, DC 20375 USA; [Ames, Cheryl L.] Tohoku Univ, Grad Sch Agr Sci, Sendai, Miyagi 9808572, Japan; [Ames, Cheryl L.; Klompen, Anna M.

Here, we investigate the metabarcoding performance of universal degenerate cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) primers in detecting species from this challenging phylum in a cryptobenthic community. Twenty-two modified Autonomous Reef Monitoring Structures (ARMS) were deployed for 2years in mesocosms receiving unfiltered seawater from an adjacent reef slope. Upon recovery, each unit was inspected by a marine sponge taxonomist who used a combination of taxonomy, imagery, and DNA barcoding (28S rRNA and COI) to identify sponges and generate a validated taxonomic richness value for each ARMS unit. A total of 69 unique sponge barcoded morphologies (BMs) were identified from the classes Calcarea, Demospongiae, and Homoscleromorpha. Metabarcoding identified 41 unique sponge molecular operational taxonomic units (MOTUs) from Demospongiae and Homoscleromorpha but the primers failed to amplify any species from the class Calcarea which comprised 22% of the BMs. Sponge richness did not differ between BMs and MOTUs assigned to the classes Demospongiae and Homoscleromorpha. However, assignments at the order and family level in Demospongiae underscore known limitations in sponge taxonomic resolution using the COI gene. The prevalence of false positives within the order Suberitida and the pervasiveness of false negatives within the order Haplosclerida highlighted both technical and biological constraints in the metabarcoding method. Overall, these results confirm the need for discretion in sponge MOTU assignments using universal degenerate barcoding primers that target a short fragment of the COI gene. However, they also demonstrate that COI metabarcoding is capable of capturing sponge richness from a complex natural community.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Environmental DNA",NA,"2022-01-01",2022,4,"1",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"10.1002/edn3.163","https://doi.org/10.1002/edn3.163",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2024-10-25",NA,NA,"BEY62NP2","2024-10-25 16:40:26","2024-10-25 16:40:26","239-253",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, eDNA sampling cannot yet offer reliable estimates of a target species' abundance/biomass or confident determinations of a species' absence from a river segment. To unlock these abilities?and thereby greatly improve eDNA as a tool for management decision-making?the influence of local environmental factors on eDNA fate must be better understood. At nine river sites across the central California coast, we added a known quantity of novel eDNA (Brook Trout, Salvelinus fontinalis) and collected eDNA at sequential downstream distances for qPCR analysis. We then used random forest modeling to identify the most important environmental factors to reach-scale (?200?m) sampling outcomes and characterize salmonid eDNA fate. Our final model identified six factors important to sampling outcomes, including five environmental factors (discharge, local catchment calcium oxide content, average depth of the sampling cross-section, presence of pools, and impervious cover of the watershed) and one factor regarding our experimental design (the number of qPCR technical replicates). Our results highlight the notable effects of cross-sectional area, turbulence, and catchment geology on eDNA fate, and we suggest the discharge and presence of pools as useful proxies for evaluating a site's favorability for eDNA recovery.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Environmental DNA",NA,"2024-09-01",2024,6,"5",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"10.1002/edn3.70001","https://doi.org/10.1002/edn3.70001",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2024-10-25",NA,NA,"IYVYCEMB","2024-10-25 16:40:26","2024-10-25 16:40:26","e70001",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In marine environments, physical characteristics?such as tides and currents?can influence the distribution of eDNA. In this study, we make use of hatchery net pens containing >46?million juvenile chum salmon (Oncorhynchus keta) in nearshore Southeast Alaska to test for dispersion of eDNA and the effects of tide. Initially, we collected and filtered surface water every 80?m along a 2?km transect to test eDNA attenuation over surface distance during incoming and outgoing tides on a single day. The following year, we sampled at three depths (0?m, 5?m, and 10?m) every 500?m along the same transect as well as along a perpendicular transect, to understand dispersion by depth and in additional directions. Chum salmon eDNA was quantified using species-specific qPCR. We found that surface samples showed a consistent signal of decreasing chum salmon eDNA across the 2?km transect (R2?=?0.665), with the majority of eDNA detections within 1.5?km of the net pens. Tide had a significant effect, resulting in higher concentrations of chum DNA throughout the transect during incoming tide and a steeper decline in eDNA over distance during outgoing tide (R2?=?0.759). Depth affected chum salmon DNA concentration, with the majority of eDNA at the surface and a decreasing amount of DNA with increasing depth. This study addresses one of the critical knowledge gaps in applying eDNA to marine fisheries management by providing empirical evidence of eDNA dispersion and demonstrating that most eDNA detections are likely from nearby individuals that are either currently or recently present. Yet even at close proximity, eDNA signal strength fluctuates and depends on the physical environmental variables during a given sampling event.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Environmental DNA",NA,"2024-03-01",2024,6,"2",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"10.1002/edn3.533","https://doi.org/10.1002/edn3.533",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2024-10-25",NA,NA,"6UK7LIVY","2024-10-25 16:40:26","2024-10-25 16:40:26","e533",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The Workshop was attended by 150 people in-person and an additional 200 more online. Workshop attendees represented a broad cross-section of disciplines and backgrounds, including research scientists, state, and federal agencies, and those in the environmental management sector. This diverse collection of attendees assembled with the goal of achieving cross-sector collaboration and working together to identify the necessary next steps to move eDNA methods into the management application mainstream. The Workshop structure included a Training Day oriented towards environmental managers and those new to eDNA science, to facilitate a common ground for discussions on subsequent days. The Plenary Day focused on case studies about eDNA applications and culminated with a roundtable panel discussion with local, state, and federal agency representatives on eDNA method readiness and the road to method adoption. Among the key takeaways from the Workshop was bridging the communication gap between researchers and managers because scientists often focus on technical details and the unknowns, giving the impression that eDNA science is not yet mature, whereas managers want to hear consensus statements about readiness and a roadmap for method adoption, including standard operating procedures, lab accreditation, and unified sequence libraries. This outcome was a clear directive for many scientists in attendance that it is time to stop letting perfect be the enemy of good and to focus future efforts on method harmonization and a national strategy towards method adoption.

The macroalgae Caulerpa prolifera is considered an invasive species outside its native range, colonizing large patches of seafloor, reducing native species, and altering ecosystem functioning. Here, we developed a droplet digital PCR assay for detection of C. prolifera from environmental DNA seawater samples using the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region. While the assay itself was confirmed to be highly efficient, we discovered concentrations of C. prolifera eDNA were present below detectable levels in the water column surrounding an outbreak. To understand why, we conducted tank-based experiments for two California invasive algae species, Caulerpa prolifera and Sargassum horneri. The steady-state eDNA concentration (eDNA copies/ gram of biomass detected) of C. prolifera was found to be two orders of magnitude lower than S. horneri. A meta-analysis of steady-state concentrations reported in the literature showed a remarkable range from ~104?1011 (copies/g), revealingC. prolifera to have the lowest recorded steady-state concentrations of eDNA of any known species. We attribute C. prolifera's low steady-state eDNA concentration to its unique biology as a unicellular macroscopic algae which reduces the possible modes of eDNA release compared to similarly sized multicellular organisms. Critically our results demonstrate the potential limits of eDNA approaches, the influence of shedding rates in the reliability of species detections, and the vital importance of benchmarking and validating eDNA assays in both field and laboratory settings.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Environmental DNA",NA,"2024-01-01",2024,6,"1",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"10.1002/edn3.496","https://doi.org/10.1002/edn3.496",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2024-10-25",NA,NA,"XW5VJPP3","2024-10-25 16:40:26","2024-10-25 16:40:26","e496",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Nevertheless, fish-specific eDNA resources are currently not well-developed, and many fish species are not yet sequenced in reference databases. We developed Mitohelper, a Python-based command line tool to annotate and align fish mitochondrial sequences available in the existing MitoFish database. Mitohelper improves MitoFish annotations by adding gene names and additional taxonomic classifications. Using these improved reference datasets, Mitohelper's getrecord function searches MitoFish for available mitochondrial (cytochrome c oxidase, 12S rRNA, and others) gene sequences against a user-provided list of fish taxonomic names. Mitohelper's getalignment function aligns (often partial) mitochondrial gene sequences to a user-specified full-length reference sequence for the assessment and visualization of overlapping sequencing regions. To facilitate the development of taxonomic classifiers, we combined Mitohelper's 12S rRNA dataset with SILVA?s 16S rRNA and 18S rRNA datasets in a QIIME 2-compatible format. By providing valuable information on taxonomic and gene region coverage of currently available fish mitochondrial data, Mitohelper's functions promote informed experimental design that can guide sequencing and analysis strategies.

To assess potential PCR bias among species, we compared reads obtained with Riaz 12?S primers to those with modified MiFish primers, which target a different 12?S gene segment. Our results provide evidence that Riaz 12?S gene metabarcoding with an internal DNA standard quantifies marine bony fish eDNA over a range of about 10?5000 copies per reaction, without indication of significant PCR bias among teleost species. In mid-Atlantic coastal samples, eDNA rarity was the main limitation to reproducible detection and quantification, and this was partly overcome by increasing the amount of a DNA sample amplified.

However, such community analyses typically are limited by time and effort of sampling, sorting, and identifications, as well as morphological character uncertainty for some taxa, especially at early life stages. Our objective was to evaluate a suite of targeted metabarcode high-throughput sequencing assays to characterize the macroinvertebrate communities (specifically targeting Annelida, Bryozoa, Crustacea, Insecta, and Mollusca) from environmental (e)DNA water samples along 160km of the Maumee River, OH (a major Lake Erie, Laurentian Great Lakes tributary). Multiple alpha (richness, Shannon Index, and Simpson's Index) and beta (Bray?Curtis and S?rensen dissimilarities) diversity metrics from the metabarcode assays were compared with an Invertebrate Community Index (ICI) metric calculated from traditional morphological sampling surveys conducted by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency. The 15 Maumee River sites varied in their ICI scores (ranging from 4 to 46), with seven sites rated as ?poor? or ?very poor? and eight scoring ?fair? or ?good.? Metabarcoding assays yielded greater gamma richness, delineating 181 Operational Taxonomic Units versus 172 taxa from morphology (the latter often limited to family or genus-level identifications). Both datasets supported similar river-wide trends, with comparable gamma, alpha, and beta diversity patterns and community compositions across habitat types and habitat quality scores. Metabarcode assays revealed similar detection of important bioindicator Insecta, but missed most Trichoptera (caddisflies). eDNA identified eight aquatic invasive species on the GLANSIS (Great Lakes Aquatic Nonindigenous Species Information System) list, including three missed by the morphological surveys (Branchiura sowerbyi, Potamothrix bedoti, and Skistodiaptomus pallidus; with Lophopodella carteri, Faxonius rusticus, Corbicula fluminea, Dreissena polymorpha, and Valvata piscinalis in both datasets).

The key to making accurate taxonomic assignments is curated, comprehensive reference barcode databases. However, the generation and curation of such databases has remained challenging given the large and continuously growing volumes of both DNA sequence data and novel reference barcode targets. Monitoring and research applications require a greater diversity of specialized gene regions and targeted taxa than are currently curated by professional staff. Thus, there is a growing need for an easy-to-implement computational tool that can generate comprehensive metabarcoding reference libraries for any bespoke locus. We address this need by reimagining CRUX from the Anacapa Toolkit and present the rCRUX package in R which, like its predecessor, relies on sequence homology and PCR primer compatibility instead of keyword searches to avoid limitations of user-defined metadata. The typical workflow involves searching for plausible seed amplicons (get_seeds_local() or get_seeds_remote()) by simulating in silico PCR to acquire a set of sequences analogous to PCR products containing a user-defined set of primer sequences. Next, these seeds are used to iteratively blast search seed sequences against a local copy of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)-formatted nt database using a taxonomic rank-based stratified random sampling approach (blast_seeds()). This results in a comprehensive set of sequence matches. This database is dereplicated and cleaned (derep_and_clean_db()) by identifying identical reference sequences and collapsing the taxonomic path to the lowest taxonomic agreement across all matching reads. This results in a curated, comprehensive database of primer-specific reference barcode sequences from NCBI. Databases can then be compared (compare_db()) to determine read and taxonomic overlap. We demonstrate that rCRUX provides more comprehensive reference databases for the MiFish Universal Teleost 12S, Taberlet trnl, fungal ITS, and Leray CO1 loci than CRABS, MetaCurator, RESCRIPt, and ecoPCR reference databases. We then further demonstrate the utility of rCRUX by generating 24 reference databases for 20 metabarcoding loci, many of which lack dedicated reference database curation efforts.

To help remedy this situation, scientists convened a session at the Second National Marine eDNA Workshop to discuss strategies for improving communications with managers. These include articulating the readiness of different eDNA applications, highlighting the strengths and limitations of eDNA tools for various applications or use cases, communicating uncertainties associated with specified uses transparently, and avoiding the exaggeration of exploratory and preliminary findings. Several key messages regarding implementation, limitations, and relationship to existing methods were prioritized. To be inclusive of the diverse managers, practitioners, and researchers, we and the other workshop participants propose the development of communication workflow plans, using RACI (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed) charts to clarify the roles of all pertinent individuals and parties and to minimize the chance for miscommunications. We also propose developing decision support tools such as Structured Decision-Making (SDM) to help balance the benefits of eDNA sampling with the inherent uncertainty, and developing an eDNA readiness scale to articulate the technological readiness of eDNA approaches for specific applications.

Further, the method has not been scaled up for 96-well magnetic bead extraction kits and robotic manipulation. We collected surface water from Bear Cut (Biscayne Bay, Florida) and performed enclosed Sterivex DNA extractions with different bead size combinations (0.1, 0.5, 0.1 + 0.5mm, and no beads) and two magnetic kits (Zymo and NucleoMag).

Bacterial relative abundance (family to ASV) was conserved across bead treatments, while several hard-to-lyse eukaryotes (diatoms and chlorophytes) were less abundant (or absent) when extracted without beads. Higher fish richness was detected with larger beads; however, relative abundance and composition were not associated with beads, likely reflecting heterogeneity or low concentrations of fish compared to microbial eDNA.

One way that cryptic marine biodiversity can be non-invasively surveyed is by analyzing environmental DNA (eDNA) present in seawater. Using coral reefs as a model system, here we compare estimates of cryptic diversity among community biomass and eDNA metabarcoding sampling methods with a broad eukaryotic marker (COI). First, contributions to eDNA were investigated across cryptobiomes through a comparison of community metabarcoded biomass from standardized autonomous reef monitoring structures (ARMS) to eDNA acquired from seawater in which individual ARMS were soaked. Second, we compared these results to those from eDNA samples taken from within reef crevices and the ambient water column. Metabarcoding of community biomass from ARMS and eDNA from the two types of water samples revealed significantly different communities of cryptic coral reef habitat with little overlap between methods. Taxa that were unique to metabarcoding of ARMS biomass were predominantly from chitinous and calcifying groups (polychaetes, palaemonid shrimp, mollusks, brittle stars, and red algae), which suggests that these taxa are underrepresented in eDNA surveys. Other than the corals themselves, sponges and red algae were significant drivers of reef crevice community differences, while ambient seawater samples detected mostly planktonic organisms and reef fishes. Our data indicate that both eDNA and ARMS provide incomplete accounting of cryptic diversity. Direct sampling of biomass is best suited for building taxonomies and improving databases, whereas eDNA methods offer rapid insights into the composition of cryptobiomes. Because each method likely captures different taxa, multiple targeted assays can be used to provide the greatest estimates of metazoan and macroalgal richness.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Environmental DNA",NA,"2022-01-01",2022,4,"1",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"10.1002/edn3.203","https://doi.org/10.1002/edn3.203",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2024-10-25",NA,NA,"HSKP4E73","2024-10-25 16:40:26","2024-10-25 16:40:26","93-107",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Using multiple primer sets that amplify different genes can mitigate biases in amplification efficiency, sequence resolution, and reference data availability, but few empirical studies have evaluated markers for complementary performance. Here, we assess the individual and joint performance of 22 markers for detecting species in a DNA pool of 98 species of marine and freshwater bony fishes from geographically and phylogenetically diverse origins. We find that a portfolio of four markers targeting 12S, 16S, and two regions of COI identifies 100% of reference taxa to family and nearly 60% to species. We then use these four markers to evaluate metabarcoding of heterogeneous tissue mixtures, using experimental fishmeal to test: (1) the tissue input threshold to ensure detection; (2) how read depth scales with tissue abundance; and (3) the effect of non-target material in the mixture on recovery of target taxa. We consistently detect taxa that makeup >1% of fishmeal mixtures and can detect taxa at the lowest input level of 0.01%, but rare taxa (<1%) were detected inconsistently across markers and replicates. Read counts showed only a weak correlation with tissue input, suggesting they are not a reliable quantitative proxy for relative abundance.

Here, we leverage eDNA metabarcoding to characterize nearshore fish communities near Juneau, Alaska, USA, a high-latitude environment with large tidal swings, strong currents, and significant freshwater input. We investigated whether species richness and community composition differed across three habitat types (sand beaches, eelgrass beds, and rocky shorelines) and between high and low tides. Additionally, we tested whether replication of field samples and PCR reactions influenced either species richness or composition. We amplified a 12S mitochondrial locus in our samples and identified 167 fish amplicon sequence variants, which were grouped into 24 unique taxa based on sequence similarity, with approximately half of these taxa resolved to single species. Species richness and composition inferred from eDNA differed substantially among habitats, with rock habitats containing fewer taxa and fewer overall detections than sand and eelgrass habitats. The effect of tide was not significant on its own, but a significant habitat-tide interaction was documented, with the most pronounced differences in taxa between tides found in sand habitats. Power analyses indicated that additional field sampling is useful to detect small changes in species richness such as those due to tide. PCR replicates typically identified few additional taxa. Our results provide important information that can be used to guide future studies, most notably, that the influence of tide on eDNA results appears to be minimal and potentially isolated to certain habitats. This suggests that replication across tides may not be vital for future eDNA studies and that additional replication across space?particularly across heterogeneous environments?likely is a better allocation of sampling effort.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Environmental DNA",NA,"2022-07-01",2022,4,"4",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"10.1002/edn3.297","https://doi.org/10.1002/edn3.297",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2024-10-25",NA,NA,"ACEUNQE4","2024-10-25 16:40:26","2024-10-25 16:40:26","868-880",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This has resulted in changes in the aquatic and terrestrial vegetation, but historical records on the composition of the past vegetation on centennial scale are scarce. In this study, we examined changes in the terrestrial and aquatic plant communities in and around Lower Lake Constance using metabarcoding of sedimentary DNA (sedDNA) of three cores from different sub-basins covering the past, up to 300years. We successfully identified an average of c. 3000sequence variants (molecular operational taxonomic units - MOTUs) and obtained a taxonomically annotated dataset of 127species, 104genera, and 72 families. We could detect major changes in the terrestrial and aquatic vegetation of the Lower Lake Constance region by examining the cores. For example, alpha diversity decreased in the last c. 100years, and this decrease was more pronounced in the terrestrial than in the aquatic plant community. Unlike the terrestrial plant community, the current aquatic plant-community composition partially resembles the community from before the 20th-century eutrophication phase of the lake. In addition to changes that can be attributed to anthropogenic impacts, we also captured the effect of DNA sedimentation on the terrestrial DNA diversity representation in sediments during periods of extensive flooding and potentially as a consequence of extremely cold winters. With sedDNA from Lower Lake Constance, we provide a new local dataset to investigate and extend the historical changes of different shoreline habitats and to identify characteristic and invasive plant species.

Here, we developed and tested a new quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay to detect Atlantic sturgeon environmental DNA (eDNA) in water samples with the goal of providing an alternative method to monitor presence and relative abundance. We also examined Atlantic sturgeon eDNA shedding rates in laboratory experiments. A qPCR-probe assay targeting Cytochrome B was developed and showed no amplification of other related and co-occurring fishes. Pond trials at a density of~0.2g/L sturgeon produced relatively strong eDNA detections (~1,000?25,000 copies/L) in all seven water samples assayed. Water samples taken from two river systems in the Chesapeake Bay produced zero eDNA detections in the summer, while fall sampling during sturgeon spawning produced positive eDNA detections in 26% of samples, though at much lower concentrations (400?1,800 copies/L) compared with the pond (mesocosm) detections. Acoustic detections of sturgeon near river sampling sites were positively associated with eDNA detections. However, the eDNA assay failed to detect the presence of sturgeon in some samples when abundances were very low or when fish were in deep water. Finally, Atlantic sturgeon eDNA shedding rates were estimated to be on the order of estimates for other fish species, which suggests that relatively weak detections in the field are not necessarily driven by low rates of eDNA shedding. Overall, eDNA analysis represents a promising new monitoring tool for Atlantic sturgeon.

This study focuses on fish community composition in marine ecosystems and aims to analyze the efficiency of sampling design given the sampling effort for distinguishing between different communities. We sampled three fjords in Northern Norway, taking samples along fjord transects and at three different depths, and amplified a fragment of the mitochondrial 12S rRNA gene of bony fishes using the MiFish primers. We evaluated the effect of (i) the number of sampling stations, (ii) samples' spatial distribution, and (iii) the data treatment approach (presence/absence versus semiquantitative) for maximizing the efficiency of eDNA metabarcoding sampling when inferring differences of fish community compositions between fjords. We found that the manner of data treatment strongly affected the minimum number of sampling stations required to detect differences among communities; because the semiquantitative approach retained some information about abundance of the underlying reads, it was the most efficient. Furthermore, we found little-to-no difference of fish communities in samples from intermediate depths when comparing vertical fish communities. Lastly, we found that the differences between fish communities at the surface were the highest across the horizontal distance and overall, samples ~30?km apart showed the highest variation in the horizontal distribution.

Here, we examine the efficacy of a dual-assay eDNA metabarcoding approach for sessile benthic bioassessments in the turbid waters of the Lalang-garram marine parks, Kimberley, north-western Australia. We ask three principal questions: (1) ?Is the eDNA released by sessile benthic taxa (i.e., hard and soft corals, sponges and tunicates) locally detectable??, (2) ?What level of taxonomic resolution is afforded by eDNA metabarcoding using the ITS2 region??, and (3) ?How well does eDNA metabarcoding compare to conventional benthic survey techniques??.We report that a dual-assay eDNA metabarcoding approach can detect approximately 70% of the local benthic taxa (i.e., at a species, genus level). It is, however, not as effective at the individual/population level, detecting only approximately 40% of unique amplicon sequence variant (ASV) signals released by an array of individual benthic organisms at the surveyed locations. In examining the efficacy and resolution of the applied ITS2 metabarcoding markers for bioassessments, we report large gaps in the variety of publicly available benthic ITS2 reference sequence data, limiting our ability to provide robust taxonomic assignments. These findings highlight the need to extend ITS2 databases for greater regional representation. Until this is adequately addressed, we recommend that investigating taxonomic assignments to a genus level is the most robust approach for benthic monitoring using eDNA. Lastly, we found eDNA metabarcoding and conventional belt transect surveys each detected numerous unique hard coral genera, indicating that a combined approach provides the most effective way to audit benthic biodiversity.

To fill this data gap, we investigated the impact of sampling effort, extraction method, and filter pore size on DNA yield, PCR inhibition, and 16S rDNA metabarcoding results for fishes in water samples collected from inshore turbid- and offshore clear-water environments. The turbid-water samples had high concentrations of suspended organic and/or inorganic material and yielded ~3.2? more DNA and exhibited high levels of PCR inhibition compared with the low-turbidity, clear-water samples. Importantly, there were no striking differences in the results of our metabarcoding experiments based on extraction method or filter pore size. While a small number of unique species of relatively low read count were detected in all turbid-water treatments, most species were consistently detected across samples. Results for the clear-water samples were strikingly different, with low DNA yield, high levels of variation across replicates, and a high number of non-overlapping species across treatments. These findings indicate a patchy distribution of eDNA in offshore environments, which means higher volumes of water ( 2L per replicate) must be filtered in habitats where target DNA is likely to be sparse. In semi-closed systems such as estuaries, higher concentrations of target DNA are expected, and we found that either a 1.0 or 3.0m filter pore size was sufficient to capture standing diversity, while decreasing the risk of clogging. For economical DNA extraction and inhibitor removal, we recommend a combination of Omega Bio-tek E.Z.N.A Tissue DNA kit followed by a PCR inhibitor removal step using the Zymo Kit.

We then compared metabarcoding data to image-based annotations of ARMS plates. Although both markers provided similar estimates of taxonomic richness and total sequence reads, marker choice skewed estimates of eukaryotic diversity. The COI marker recovered relative abundances of the dominant sessile phyla consistent with image annotations. Both COI and the image annotations provided higher relative abundance estimates of Bryozoa and Porifera and lower estimates of Chordata as compared to 18S, but 18S recovered 25% more phyla than COI. Thus, while COI more reliably reflects the occurrence of dominant sessile phyla, 18S provides a more holistic representation of overall taxonomic diversity. Ideal marker choice is, therefore, contingent on study system and research question, especially in relation to desired taxonomic resolution, and a multimarker approach provides the greatest application across a broad range of research objectives.

From 2009 through 2011, collaborators and I provided research, development, and application of eDNA to invasive species management in the CAWS in cooperation with the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). The research team's approach was a high-stakes test of a novel combination of proven technologies (field sampling techniques and laboratory genetics). In the first application of eDNA to a large scale, urgent management goal, we quickly discovered eDNA of two species of bigheaded carps in parts of the waterway where traditional tools had not captured fish. The central research question was whether the sensitivity (probability of detecting a fish when it was present) of eDNA was higher than that of traditional fish sampling tools (e.g., nets, electrofishing). The effort was part of what became a very large, complex, on-going initiative to reduce access by invasive species to Lake Michigan. This immediately garnered much attention, initiating a dialog about the reliability of eDNA, public discussion about the benefits and costs of the CAWS, and skepticism from industries that use the CAWS. Government agencies formed the Asian Carp Rapid Response Workgroup, which eventually became the Invasive Carp Regional Coordinating Committee (ICRCC). The ICRCC continues its coordinating role on the use of eDNA and other management responses in the CAWS. With the benefit of hindsight, I draw several lessons from the experience that may help in other settings where eDNA is now being deployed with increasing confidence and acceptance; evaluate the on-going CAWS surveillance and management effort; and recommend strengthening the current approach by broadening and deepening participation in a collaborative governance approach.

However, ProK is expensive and may be unnecessary when samples are protein-limited, such as environmental DNA (eDNA) from oligotrophic seawater. To investigate this, we filtered seawater through Sterivex cartridges from a mesocosm receiving input from the adjacent coral reef slope at the Hawai?i Institute of Marine Biology. We tested whether the addition of varying levels of ProK (0??L, 25??L, 50??L, 100??L, or 150??L?20?mg/mL stock concentrations) to 1.8?mL of lysis buffer affected DNA yield and the diversity, community composition, and detection of known organisms within the mesocosm community based on zero-width operational taxonomic units (ZOTUs) obtained from DNA metabarcoding. We found no significant differences in diversity metrics among ProK quantities and dominant ZOTUs were consistent across concentrations. Over 50% of detected ZOTUs were shared among samples and only two ZOTUs were unique to samples of a particular ProK concentration. While the community composition among ProK quantities differed, pairwise community comparisons between quantities were not statistically significant and matched the known species composition of the mesocosm. These results suggest that rare ZOTUs and eDNA patchiness are driving overall community differences as opposed to extraction ingredients.

As a result, chum salmon were listed as threatened under the U.S. Endangered Species Act in 1999. Recovery strategies have been developed, but limited baseline data on distribution impedes implementation of these strategies. Traditional methods for identifying spawning distribution (e.g., spawning ground surveys) may be inadequate for rare species like chum salmon because of a low detection probability. In contrast, environmental DNA (eDNA) sampling is extremely sensitive to species presence and has the potential to supplement or replace existing methods for monitoring listed species. However, legal and administrative issues associated with accurately describing distribution of a listed species put a premium on understanding factors that influence detection of a species by eDNA sampling. In this study, we (a) developed and tested a quantitative PCR-based eDNA assay for chum salmon, (b) collected eDNA samples to describe the spawning distribution of this species in Columbia River tributaries between Bonneville and The Dalles Dams, and (c) tested whether spawn surveyors could inadvertently transport chum salmon DNA between streams on their boots and waders. The newly developed assay was specific and sensitive to chum salmon DNA in both tissue and eDNA samples. Chum salmon DNA was detected in the positive control site and in four streams, which increased known contemporary spawning locations in the study area. In the contamination trial, surveyors successfully introduced chum salmon DNA into the study area but eDNA was only detected intermittently and locally over the next 11days. The accuracy of eDNA sampling, combined with success in detecting a rare species at the population scale, makes this technique well-suited for monitoring recolonization of chum salmon during the recovery process.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Environmental DNA",NA,"2021-05-01",2021,3,"3",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"10.1002/edn3.159","https://doi.org/10.1002/edn3.159",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2024-10-25",NA,NA,"G92HX4NX","2024-10-25 16:41:23","2024-10-25 16:41:23","631-642",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Rapid and widespread monitoring is essential for tracking ecosystem responses, but assessment of coral communities traditionally relies on time-consuming visual estimates of coral cover, the percentage of substrate occupied by living corals. The analysis of environmental DNA (eDNA) offers fast and efficient insights into the abundance and distribution of species, yet it remains untested to monitor coral biomass. Here, we demonstrate that visual estimates are highly correlated with the abundance of coral eDNA on reefs in Hawai'i measured with a relatively simple, rapid, but replicated PCR-based metabarcoding approach. Target sequence length was also tested by amplifying short (~120 base-pairs) and long (~400 base-pairs) fragments from the same region of two mitochondrial DNA genes, 16S ribosomal DNA, and cytochrome oxidase-1 using primers designed to preferentially amplify Hawaiian coral genera. Careful primer selection and target sequence lengths play an important role in determination of coral abundance from eDNA biomass.

The objectives of this study were to use autonomous sampling to conduct long-term, high-frequency monitoring of the eDNA of native salmonid species in a Californian coastal stream, describe temporal variation of eDNA on multiple scales and identify environmental factors that drive this variation, and evaluate the ability of the eDNA datasets to detect rare species and represent organismal abundance. Using high-throughput autonomous environmental sample processors (ESPs) and qPCR, we enumerated eDNA concentrations from 674 water samples collected at subdaily intervals over 360days at a single site. We detected eDNA from two imperiled salmonids (coho salmon Oncorhynchus kisutch and steelhead/rainbow trout O. mykiss) in most samples; O. kisutch eDNA was generally in lower concentration and more variable than O. mykiss eDNA. High-frequency (i.e., subdaily and daily) variability in salmonid eDNA concentrations showed occasional patchiness (i.e., large differences between consecutive samples), while seasonal differences were observed consistent with the ecology of the species at this site. Salmonid eDNA concentrations were significantly associated with creek discharge, photoperiod, and whether the creek mouth was open or closed by a seasonal sandbar. The release of hatchery-origin O. kisutch parr into the stream was associated with a significant increase in eDNA concentration for the remainder of the study. We compared eDNA signals with fish abundance data collected from traps located at the site. Fish were detected more often by eDNA than from trapping. Significant positive associations between fish abundance and eDNA concentrations were observed for O. mykiss; however, no such associations were observed for O. kisutch.

During this period, the micro-habitats transitioned from being interconnected, to physically isolated, to interconnected again. Using a well-established eukaryotic (cytochrome oxidase subunit I) metabarcoding assay, we detected 415 species across 28 phyla. Across a variety of univariate and multivariate analyses, using exclusively taxonomically assigned data as well as all detected amplicon sequence variants (ASVs), we identified unique eDNA signals from the different micro-habitats sampled. This differentiability paralleled expected ecological gradients and increased as the sites became more physically disconnected. Our results demonstrate that eDNA biomonitoring can differentiate micro-habitats in the rocky intertidal only 40?m apart, that these differences reflect known ecology in the area, and that physical connectivity informs the degree of differentiation possible.

The first arises from a failure to distinguish between false-positive eDNA detection at the sample level and false-positive inference of taxa presence at the site level. The second is based on the large proportion of false positives that may occur when true-positive detections are likely to be rare, even when rates of contamination or other error are low. And the third misunderstanding occurs when conventional species detection approaches, often based on direct capture, are used to confirm eDNA approaches without acknowledging or quantifying the conventional approach's detection probability. The solutions to these issues include careful and consistent communication of error definitions, managing expectations of error rates, and providing a balanced discussion not only of alternative sources of species DNA, but also of the detection limitations of conventional methods.

As these efforts expand, a persistent challenge is simply locating this rare and highly cryptic species in the field, limiting the ability to identify critical habitat and locate wild adults to serve as restoration broodstock. Here, we tested the use of environmental DNA (eDNA) to detect pinto abalone. Using a quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay previously developed for larval pinto abalone, we first evaluated its sensitivity to abalone eDNA in aquaria settings, finding a positive relationship between abalone biomass and the concentration of abalone DNA. We then tested abalone eDNA detection in the field by collecting replicate water samples from abalone restoration sites, using an occupancy model to estimate detection probability in relation to abalone biomass estimated via diver surveys. Both eDNA concentration and detection probability were positively associated with diver-estimated abalone biomass. By modifying the assay for droplet digital PCR (ddPCR), detection probability increased by 32%?89% over qPCR. eDNA surveys using ddPCR had higher error (CV=96.9%) than diver surveys (CV=29.4%) but were more efficient, taking approximately 1/10th of the person-hours per site of a diver survey.

For these reasons, they are of particular interest at present to resource managers seeking to restore and conserve reefs that are facing a myriad of stressors. To contribute to our understanding of the diet breadth and potential vulnerability of these important fishes, we employed metabarcoding to identify and compare the algal diets of two common Hawaiian surgeonfishes, the convict tang or manini (Acanthurus triostegus) and the brown surgeonfish or ma?i?i?i (A.nigrofuscus). These species serve important biological and cultural roles in Hawaiian coral reef ecosystems, and manini, in particular, constitute an essential component of traditional Hawaiian diets. Although diet richness was not significantly different between the species, with 64 unique taxa identified from the gut contents of 89 A.triostegus and 57 taxa from 73 A.nigrofuscus, A.nigrofuscus exhibited greater diet diversity as measured by the Simpson's Diversity Index. A.nigrofuscus had a greater relative read abundance of brown algae, cyanobacteria, and material from the epilithic algal matrix. A.triostegus had a taxonomically more specialized diet, consuming primarily red algae.

We evaluated the success of the sampling methods individually and in combination to determine the allocation of effort and cost across sampling gear that provides the optimal approach for lake-wide species inventories. We found that eDNA metabarcoding detected more species than any other sampling method, including 11 species that were not detected with any capture-based approach. Optimal gear combination analyses revealed that detected species richness is maximized when most of the effort or budget is allocated to eDNA metabarcoding, with smaller allocations to seining and fyke netting. eDNA metabarcoding and capture sampling gear showed similar patterns of spatial heterogeneity in the fish community across habitat types, with pelagic samples forming a group that was distinct from nearshore samples.

Methods To determine spatial distributions of at-risk native taxa and AIS in two biologically diverse Laurentian Great Lakes tributaries, we extracted environmental DNA (eDNA) from water samples and used a universal PCR primer set targeting the CO1 gene for metabarcoding of selected taxa. We sampled 43 sites for eDNA in each of the Grand and Sydenham rivers in southwestern Ontario. Results We assigned sequences to 49 taxa at the species level and four mollusks to genus level. Detected AIS included two oligochaete worms (Branchiura sowerbyi, Potamothrix moldaviensis), a freshwater jellyfish (Craspedacusta sowerbyi), a calanoid copepod (Skistodiaptomus pallidus), and a bivalve dreissenid mussel (Dreissena rostriformis bugensis). All but D. r. bugensis were previously unreported in these tributaries. Detected native mollusks included one globally endangered species the rayed bean (Villosa fabalis), one provincially listed threatened species the maple leaf mussel (Quadrula quadrula), and several other at-risk and unique mollusk species of special interest in Ontario, Canada, and the United States (e.g., Sphaerium fabale, Pyganodon grandis). At several sampling sites in each river, AIS eDNA overlapped with or was near to sites with detections of at-risk native mollusks. Most AIS and some native taxa demonstrated clustered detection patterns within each river. However, in some cases, independent detections of individual species occurred at individual sites within each river that were relatively far apart. Our findings should be interpreted with some caution due to the limitations of the aquatic ?universal? primer set and the availability of comprehensive reference sequence databases.

Herbivore diets have been examined using a myriad of methods, making it difficult to compare between analyses and to examine consistency or variability in diet across large spatial scales or heterogeneous environments. Here, we present a method to quantify and validate the diet diversity of these important coral reef species. We compile a database of information on Pacific herbivorous reef fishes through a systematic review of published diet data, and for those studies in which appropriate information is reported, we calculate a single Simpson's Diversity Index value to represent the diet diversity of each. We then validate this approach by examining the diet diversity of five species using DNA metabarcoding to sequence the algae present in their stomach contents. The two approaches provided comparable estimates of diet diversity, and we find evidence for considerable diet variability both within functional groups and between closely related species. Although there is a wide range of diet specialization within each functional and taxonomic group, parrotfishes and detritivorous surgeonfishes appear to have more limited diets than other nominal herbivorous fishes in our survey. This may make them more vulnerable to habitat degradation, which is important considering that both groups face considerable fishing pressure in Hawai?i and elsewhere in the Pacific. Finally, we demonstrate how this approach to quantifying diet can be incorporated into trait matrices that offer valuable insight into the dissimilarity between species, regardless of their taxonomic and functional classification.

We combined targeted droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) quantification of two commercially important species, Atlantic mackerel (Scombrus scombrus) and Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus), with metabarcoding of fish and plankton communities. The goal of this study was to assess the performance of eDNA data to characterize pelagic communities and its use for environmental monitoring. The metabarcoding recovered 26 fish species including both pelagic and demersal taxa. The plankton data were dominated by dinoflagellates (Karenia) and calanoid copepods. We found that both specific quantification of eDNA from mackerel and herring and eDNA metabarcoding of fish communities were able to reveal spatial patterns: Mackerel was most abundant in the surface across both OWF and reference sites; herring was present at a wider depth range. While ddPCR and metabarcoding data for these two species were broadly congruent, we observed detection/non-detection mismatches for both methods, highlighting the need for robust sampling design. There was no consistent OWF versus reference area pattern in the demersal fraction of fish assemblages. We interpret our findings as representing a snapshot of fish school location around the time of sampling, and do not consider the single timepoint data from this pilot study to be sufficient to attribute any effects to the OWF itself. As a non-invasive tool, we conclude that eDNA has a high potential in future environmental monitoring of OWFs.

This study uses environmental DNA (eDNA) to survey fish communities across a well-documented biodiversity gradient in Indonesia. A total of 6,608,693 sequence reads of MiFish 12S rRNA from 39 sites spanning seven regions of Indonesia revealed 1099 fish amplified sequence variants (ASVs), 80.4% of which could be identified to species. Regional fish diversity broadly conformed to expectations, with the highest fish biodiversity in Raja Ampat and lowest in Western Indonesia. Similarly, zeta diversity analysis showed greater community turnover in higher diversity reefs of Eastern Indonesia and greater community similarity in low diversity regions of Western Indonesia. However, despite a twofold difference in fish diversity between Eastern and Western Indonesia, mean ASVs recovered per 1-L seawater was relatively similar across all regions. Moreover, although ASV recovery from individual seawater samples saturated, ASV recovery did not saturate at the site or region level, indicating that sampling/sequencing efforts employed in lower diversity ecosystems are insufficient for biodiversity hotspots like the Coral Triangle. Despite these limitations, eDNA substantially increased (36.3%?84.1%; mean 57.1%) the number of fish species recorded during intensive visual surveys, adding pelagic (tuna, jacks, scads, mackerels), nocturnal (soldierfish, lanternfish), and crevice-dwelling species (eels, blennies, gobies) that are difficult to document in visual surveys.

We used environmental DNA (eDNA) to characterize fish biodiversity within Drakes Estero. We amplified fish eDNA with MiFish primers and classified sequences with a 12S rRNA reference database. We identified 110 unique operational taxonomic units (OTUs, at 97% similarity) within the estuary from 40 samples across 4 sites. From these 110 OTUs, we identified 9 species and 13 taxonomic groups at the genus, family, order, or class level within the estuary. Species-level assignments are limited by a lack of representative sequences targeted by the MiFish primers for 42% of eelgrass fishes in our region that we identified from a literature review in the Northeast Pacific (NEP) from Elkhorn Slough to Humboldt Bay. Despite this limitation, we identified some common Drakes Estero fishes with our eDNA surveys, including the three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus), Pacific staghorn sculpin (Leptocottus armatus), surfperches (Embiotocidae), gobies (Gobiidae), and a hound shark (Triakidae). We also compared fish biodiversity within the estuary with that from nearby Limantour Beach, a coastal site. Limantour beach differed in community composition from Drakes Estero and was characterized by high relative abundances of anchovy (Engraulis sp.) and herring (Clupea sp.).

We compared eDNA metabarcoding and trawling data to evaluate their efficiency to characterize demersal fish communities in the Estuary and Gulf of Saint-Lawrence, Canada. Seawater and bottom trawling samples were collected in parallel at 84 stations. For a subset of 30 of these stations, water was also collected at three different depths (15, 50, and 250m) across the water column.

We detected a total of 88 fish species with both methods combined, with 72 species being detected by eDNA, 64 species detected by trawl, and 47 species (53%) overlapped between both methods. eDNA was more efficient for quantifying species richness, mainly because it detected species known to be less vulnerable to trawling gear. Our results indicated that the relative abundance estimated by eDNA and trawl is significantly correlated for species detected by both methods, while the relationship was also influenced by environmental variables (temperature, depth, salinity, and oxygen).

In the ocean, photosymbiosis between heterotrophic hosts and microalgae is powered by photosynthesis and relies on the transfer of organic carbon to the host (e.g. sugars). Yet, the identity of transferred carbohydrates as well as the molecular mechanisms that drive this exchange remain largely unknown, especially in unicellular photosymbioses that are widespread in the open ocean. Combining genomics, single-holobiont transcriptomics, and environmental metatranscriptomics, we revealed the transportome of the marine microalga Phaeocystis in symbiosis within acantharia, with a focus on sugar transporters. At the genomic level, the sugar transportome of Phaeocystis is comparable to non-symbiotic haptophytes. By contrast, we found significant remodeling of the expression of the transportome in symbiotic microalgae compared to the free-living stage. More particularly, 36% of sugar transporter genes were differentially expressed. Several of them, such as GLUTs, TPTs, and aquaporins, with glucose, triose-phosphate sugars, and glycerol as potential substrates, were upregulated at the holobiont and community level. We also showed that algal sugar transporter genes exhibit distinct temporal expression patterns during the day. This reprogramed transportome indicates that symbiosis has a major impact on sugar fluxes within and outside the algal cell, and highlights the complexity and the dynamics of metabolic exchanges between partners. This study improves our understanding of the molecular players of the metabolic connectivity underlying the ecological success of planktonic photosymbiosis and paves the way for more studies on transporters across photosymbiotic models.","[Juery, Caroline; Chevalier, Fabien; Yee, Daniel P.; Decelle, Johan] Univ Grenoble Alpes, Cell & Plant Physiol Lab, Ctr Natl Rech Sci CNRS, Unite Mixte Rech UMR 5168,Ctr Energie Atom CEA,INR, F-38000 Grenoble, France; [Auladell, Adria; Richter, Daniel J.] Univ Pompeu Fabra, CSIC, Inst Biol Evolut, Barcelona 08003, Spain; [Fussy, Zoltan; Allen, Andrew E.] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Fussy, Zoltan; Allen, Andrew E.] J Craig Venter Inst, Microbial & Environm Genom, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Pelletier, Eric] Univ Paris Saclay, Univ Evry, CNRS, Genom Metab,Genoscope,Inst Biol Francois Jacob,CEA, F-91000 Evry, France; [Pelletier, Eric] Res Federat Study Global Ocean Syst Ecol & Evolut, FR2022 Tara GOsee, F-75000 Paris, France; [Corre, Erwan] Sorbonne Univ, Ctr Natl Rech Sci, Stn Biol Roscoff, F-29680 Roscoff, France","Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - National Institute for Biology (INSB); Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); Pompeu Fabra University; University of California System; University of California San Diego; Scripps Institution of Oceanography; J.

However, our understanding of these effects in the wild is incomplete, in part due to the rarity of sufficient genetic and demographic data needed to measure their impact. The genomics revolution is promising a potential solution by predicting the effects of deleterious genetic variants (genetic load) bioinformatically from genome sequences alone bypassing the need for costly demographic data. After a historical perspective on the theoretical and empirical basis of our understanding of the dynamics and fitness effects of deleterious genetic variation, we evaluate the potential for these new genomic measures of genetic load to predict population viability. We argue that current genomic analyses alone cannot reliably predict the effects of deleterious genetic variation on population growth, because these depend on demographic, ecological and genetic parameters that need more than just genome sequence data to be measured. Thus, while purely genomic analyses of genetic load promise to improve our understanding of the composition of the genetic load, they are currently of little use for evaluating population viability. Demographic data and ecological context remain crucial to our understanding of the consequences of deleterious genetic variation for population fitness. However, when combined with such demographic and ecological data, genomic information can offer important insights into genetic variation and inbreeding that are crucial for conservation decision making.","[Kardos, Marty] NOAA, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Northwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Conservat Biol Div, Seattle, WA 98115 USA; [Keller, Lukas F.] Univ Zurich, Dept Evolutionary Biol & Environm Studies, Zurich, Switzerland; [Keller, Lukas F.] Univ Zurich, Nat Hist Museum, Zurich, Switzerland; [Funk, W.

Questions persist about the potential for A. monilatum to negatively affect aquatic organisms. Its main toxin, goniodomin A (GDA), a polyketide macrolide, has been shown to have adverse effects on animals, for example through cytotoxicity and interaction with actin.MethodsEastern oysters Crassostrea virginica were exposed for 96 h to sublethal concentrations of A. monilatum (615 +/- 47 cells/mL [average +/- SD]; containing mainly intracellular GDA [215 +/- 7.15 pg/cell] and to a lesser extent goniodomin B, goniodomin C, and GDA seco-acid as quantified by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry) or to nontoxic phytoplankton or were unexposed. They were subsequently depurated for 96 h by exposure to nontoxic phytoplankton. Clearance rates were estimated, and oysters were sampled daily and tissue (gill, digestive gland, and remaining tissues) excised for analyses by histopathology, gene expression quantified by quantitative PCR, and goniodomin quantification.ResultA positive clearance rate, no mortality, and no tissue pathologies were observed in oysters exposed to A. monilatum. Goniodomin A was detected in gill 6 h after exposure (504 +/- 329 mu g/kg [average +/- SE]) and to a lesser extent in the digestive gland and remaining soft tissues. In the digestive gland, a trend of transformation of GDA to GDA seco-acid was observed. The majority of toxins (>= 83%) were depurated after 96 h. Expression of genes involved in oxidative response increased 14-fold after 6 h, and those involved in actin synthesis showed a 27-fold change after 24 h, while expression of apoptosis genes increased 6.9-fold after 96 h compared with the control (eastern oysters exposed to nontoxic phytoplankton).ConclusionExposure experiments (nonsublethal or chronic) should be carried out to better assess the threat of this species and toxins for eastern oysters and other marine organisms.","[Gaillard, Sylvain; Small, Hamish J.; Carnegie, Ryan B.; Reece, Kimberly S.] William & Mary, Virginia Inst Marine Sci, Gloucester Point, VA 23062 USA; [Gaillard, Sylvain] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; [Harris, Thomas M.] Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Chem, Nashville, TN USA; [Tanniou, Simon; Reveillon, Damien; Hess, Philipp] Ifremer, PHYTOX Unit, Nantes, France","William & Mary; Virginia Institute of Marine Science; Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution; Vanderbilt University; Ifremer","Gaillard, S (corresponding author), William & Mary, Virginia Inst Marine Sci, Gloucester Point, VA 23062 USA.;Gaillard, S (corresponding author), Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.","sylvain.gllrd@gmail.com","","","NOAA [NA17NOS4780182]; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ECOHAB; VIMS Foundation; Memorial Endowment for Oyster Disease Research","NOAA(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ECOHAB(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); VIMS Foundation; Memorial Endowment for Oyster Disease Research","This work was funded by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ECOHAB grant #NA17NOS4780182.

The results show that ddPCR offers higher sensitivity and quantification precision, particularly at low DNA concentrations (< 1 copy/mu L reaction), than qPCR. These findings highlight the superior performance of ddPCR for eDNA detection at low concentrations, guiding researchers towards more reliable methods for effective species monitoring. Additionally, this study indicates that a two-step (detection and concentration) model increased the precision of qPCR results, useful for enhancing the robustness of eDNA quantification.

These historical declines and hatchery contributions have led to uncertainty surrounding whether many contemporary populations are native, introgressed with hatchery sources, or entirely of hatchery origin. Such uncertainty is problematic for the conservation of native biodiversity as it hampers management agencies' ability to prioritize the conservation of indigenous locally adapted populations. Fortunately, genetic and genomic tools have allowed researchers to investigate these questions, often through the use of clustering or assignment approaches that are predicated on identifiable and consistent divergence between native populations and hatchery sources. Here, we apply these methods to restriction-site associated DNA (RAD) data from 643 brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) originating from 13 wild populations and an exogenous hatchery strain to investigate the extent of historical extirpations, hatchery contributions, and processes affecting population structure in a small area of the previously unglaciated Driftless Area of Wisconsin, USA. The results from these analyses suggest that wild populations in this region are genetically distinct even at small spatial scales, lack strong hydrologically associated population structure, rarely exchange gene flow, and have small effective population sizes. Furthermore, wild populations are substantially diverged from known hatchery strains and show minimal evidence of introgression in clustering analyses. However, we demonstrate through empirically informed simulations that distinct wild populations may potentially be hatchery-founded and have since diverged through rapid genetic drift. Collectively, the apparent lack of hydrological population structure and potential for rapid drift in the Driftless Area suggest that many native populations may have been historically extirpated and refounded by stocking events.

Abalone, broadcast-spawning marine snails associated with shallow rocky habitats, have experienced widespread declines, and all seven North American species are threatened. We investigated the connectivity and population genomics of pinto/northern abalone (Haliotis kamtschatkana), the widest-ranging of abalone species. We employed reduced representation sequencing (RADseq) to generate single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data, assessing population connectivity and potential adaptive variation at 12 locations across the full range from Alaska to Mexico. Despite depleted populations, our analysis of over 6000 SNPs across nearly 300 individuals revealed that pinto abalone maintains a high genetic diversity with no evidence of a genetic bottleneck. Neutral population structure and isolation by distance were extremely weak, indicating panmixia across the species' range (global FST = 0.0021). Phylogenetic analysis, principal components analysis, and unsupervised clustering methods all supported a single genetic population. However, slight population differentiation was noted in the Salish Sea and Inside Passage regions, with evidence for higher barriers to dispersal relative to outer coastal areas. This north-central region may also represent the species' ancestral range based on relatively low population-specific FST values; the northern and southern extremes of the range likely represent range expansions. Outlier analysis did not identify consensus loci implicated in adaptive variation, suggesting limited adaptive differentiation. Our study sheds light on the evolutionary history and contemporary gene flow of this threatened species, providing key insights for conservation strategies, particularly in sourcing broodstock for ongoing restoration efforts.","[Dimond, J.

STX inhibits voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs), affecting the propagation of action potentials. Consumption of seafood contaminated with STX is responsible for paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP). Humans are among the species most sensitive to PSP; neurological symptoms of exposure range from tingling of the extremities to severe paralysis. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of STX exposure on developmental processes during early embryogenesis. This study was designed to test the hypothesis that early developmental exposure to STX would disrupt key processes, particularly those related to neural development. Zebrafish embryos were exposed to STX (24 or 48 pg) or vehicle (0.3 mM HCl) at 6 h post fertilization (hpf) via microinjection. There was no overt toxicity but starting at 36 hpf there was a temporary lack of pigmentation in STX-injected embryos, which resolved by 72 hpf. Using high performance liquid chromatography, we found that STX was retained in embryos up to 72 hpf in a dose-dependent manner. Temporal transcriptional profiling of embryos exposed to 48 pg STX per embryo revealed no differentially expressed genes (DEGs) at 24 hpf, but at 36 and 48 hpf, there were 3547 and 3356 DEGs, respectively. KEGG pathway analysis revealed significant enrichment of genes related to focal adhesion, adherens junction and regulation of actin cytoskeleton, suggesting that cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix interactions were affected by STX. Genes affected are critical for axonal growth and the development of functional neural networks. We confirmed these findings by visualizing axonal defects in transgenic zebrafish with fluorescently labeled sensory neurons. In addition, our gene expression results suggest that STX exposure affects both canonical and noncanonical functions of VGSCs. Given the fundamental role of VGSCs in both physiology and development, these findings offer valuable insights into effects of exposure to neurotoxins.","[Aluru, Neelakanteswar; Chapman, Daniel P.; Karchner, Sibel I.; Stegeman, John J.; Hahn, Mark E.] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Biol Dept, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; [Aluru, Neelakanteswar; Chapman, Daniel P.; Karchner, Sibel I.; Stegeman, John J.; Hahn, Mark E.] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Ctr Oceans & Human Hlth, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; [Becker, Kevin W.; Van Mooy, Benjamin A.

There is currently a need for health indicators that can be easily collected and used to assess and monitor the response to stressors in whales. Comparative transcriptomics using skin tissue can be used to provide understanding of organismal responses to stressors at the cellular level. Methods For this study, intra- and inter-population comparisons were performed using the skin transcriptomes obtained from Bristol Bay (BB) belugas sampled in spring and late summer, and Eastern Chukchi Sea (ECS) belugas sampled in early summer in Alaska to investigate significantly differentially expressed genes over 2-fold change (padj<0.05). Results Both principal component and hierarchical clustering analysis showed separate clustering of ECS whales, with further clustering of BB whales based on season. Intra-population comparisons carried out between different sexes and age groups did not result in any significant changes. However, the samples collected in spring versus summer within BB stock resulted in 541 significantly regulated genes, with significant activation (z-score >=|2|) predictions in pathways related with extracellular matrix organization, collagen biosynthesis and degradation, wound healing and cytokine signaling, potentially suggesting epidermal changes occurring in preparation for the seasonal molt in BB whales. The inter-population comparisons performed separately for BB-Spring versus ECS and BB-Summer versus ECS resulted in 574 and 938 significantly regulated genes, respectively. The significantly enriched canonical pathways common to both comparisons suggest increased cell survival and host defense responses along with increased cellular maintenance and growth in BB whales, and increased inflammation in ECS whales. Discussion These changes observed could potentially be due to differences in molting, bias in hunting preferences and/or differences in environmental conditions during the time of sampling. Findings from this study suggest comparative skin transcriptomics as a useful tool towards understanding biologically relevant gene expression differences at different temporal and spatial scales among beluga stocks with potential to inform and contribute to conservation and recovery of endangered beluga stocks.","[Unal, Ebru; Romano, Tracy A.] Myst Aquarium, Res Dept, Mystic, CT 06355 USA; [Unal, Ebru; Romano, Tracy A.] Univ Connecticut, Dept Marine Sci, Groton, CT 06340 USA; [Singh, Vijender] Univ Connecticut, Computat Biol Core, Storrs, CT USA; [Suydam, Robert] North Slope Borough, Dept Wildlife Management, Utqiagvik, AK USA; [Goertz, Caroline E.

Coral restoration is addressing this decline by outplanting large volumes of corals onto reef systems. Understanding how outplanted corals react at a transcriptomic level to different outplant locations over time is important, as it will highlight how habitat affects the coral host and influences physiological measures. In this study, the transcriptomic dynamics of four genets of outplanted Acropora palmata were assessed over a year at three reef sites in the Florida Keys. Genet identity was more important than time of sampling or outplant site, with differing levels of baseline immune and protein production the key drivers. Once accounting for genet, enriched growth processes were identified in the winter, and increased survival and immune expression were found in the summer. The effect of the reef site was small, with hypothesized differences in autotrophic versus heterotrophic dependent on outplant depth. We hypothesize that genotype identity is an important consideration for reef restoration, as differing baseline gene expression could play a role in survivorship and growth. Additionally, outplanting during cooler winter months may be beneficial due to higher expression of growth processes, allowing establishment of outplants on the reef system.","[Young, Benjamin D.; Williams, Dana E.; Bright, Allan J.; Peterson, Annie; Rosales, Stephane M.] Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine Atmospher & Earth Sci, Cooperat Inst Marine & Atmospher Sci, Miami, FL 33146 USA; [Young, Benjamin D.; Rosales, Stephane M.] NOAA, Atlantic Oceanog & Meteorol Lab, Miami, FL 33149 USA; [Young, Benjamin D.; Traylor-Knowles, Nikki] Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine Atmospher & Earth Sci, Dept Marine Biol & Ecol, Miami, FL 33146 USA; [Williams, Dana E.; Bright, Allan J.; Peterson, Annie] Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Southeast Fisheries Sci Ctr, NOAA, Miami, FL USA","University of Miami; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Atlantic Oceanographic & Meteorological Laboratory (AOML); University of Miami; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA","Young, BD (corresponding author), Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine Atmospher & Earth Sci, Cooperat Inst Marine & Atmospher Sci, Miami, FL 33146 USA.;Young, BD (corresponding author), NOAA, Atlantic Oceanog & Meteorol Lab, Miami, FL 33149 USA.;Young, BD (corresponding author), Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine Atmospher & Earth Sci, Dept Marine Biol & Ecol, Miami, FL 33146 USA.","benjamindouglasyoung1993@gmail.com","","","NOAA Omics Initiative; Cooperative Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Studies; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)","NOAA Omics Initiative(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); Cooperative Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Studies; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA)","We would like to thank Caroline Dennison, Dr. Allyson DeMerlis, Samara Neufield, and Dr. Ana Palacio-Castro for helping collect samples of Acropora palmata in the field.

Environmental DNA (eDNA) sequencing promises to be a noninvasive strategy to complement conventional approaches for mapping and monitoring the distribution and biodiversity of coral communities. Primers for eDNA metabarcoding have been designed to amplify nuclear and mitochondrial DNA barcodes in shallow scleractinians and mitochondrial MutS in deep-sea octocorals. However, a comprehensive method for eDNA metabarcoding of all anthozoan corals, including black corals, has not been developed. We leveraged a sequence database of global coral collections, from shallow water to the deep sea, to design new PCR primers for coral eDNA sequencing that target the 28S rRNA gene ( 28S rDNA). We tested the performance of these primers by amplifying and sequencing eDNA from water samples collected in the Gulf of Mexico near mesophotic and deep-sea corals that were also imaged, sampled, and sequenced. Sequencing libraries produced using the primers were highly enriched in eDNA from octocorals, black corals and scleractinians, with up to 99.9% of the reads originating from these corals. Further, the 28S barcode amplified using the primers distinguished coral genera and species in many cases, like previously developed methods that target eDNA in only octocorals or scleractinians. We recovered amplicon sequencing variants (ASVs) identical to DNA barcodes derived from Sanger sequencing and genome skimming of corals sampled at the same fi eld sites. This new eDNA metabarcoding strategy permits targeted eDNA sequencing of black corals, octocorals, and scleractinians at sites where they co-occur and expands our current toolkit for mapping and monitoring coral communities in shallow coral reefs and the deep sea.","[McCartin, Luke; Vohsen, Samuel A.; Pittoors, Nicole; Demetriades, Penny; Herrera, Santiago] Lehigh Univ, Lehigh Oceans Res Ctr, Bethlehem, PA 18015 USA; [McCartin, Luke; Vohsen, Samuel A.; Pittoors, Nicole; Demetriades, Penny; Herrera, Santiago] Lehigh Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Bethlehem, PA 18015 USA; [Saso, Emma; Quattrini, Andrea M.; Herrera, Santiago] Smithsonian Natl Museum Nat Hist, Dept Invertebrate Zool, Washington, DC 20560 USA; [McFadden, Catherine S.] Harvey Mudd Coll, Dept Biol, Claremont, CA USA","Lehigh University; Lehigh University; Smithsonian Institution; Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History; Claremont Colleges; Harvey Mudd College","Herrera, S (corresponding author), Lehigh Univ, Lehigh Oceans Res Ctr, Bethlehem, PA 18015 USA.;Herrera, S (corresponding author), Lehigh Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Bethlehem, PA 18015 USA.;Herrera, S (corresponding author), Smithsonian Natl Museum Nat Hist, Dept Invertebrate Zool, Washington, DC 20560 USA.","santiago.herrera@lehigh.edu","Herrera, Santiago/E-5953-2011","VOHSEN, SAMUEL ARTHUR/0000-0003-1710-292X","National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Oceanic and Atmospheric Research, Office of Ocean Exploration and Research [NA18OAR0110289]; NOAA's National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science, Competitive Research Program [NA18NOS4780166]; National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, Gulf Research Program, Early-Career Fellowship [2000013668]","National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Oceanic and Atmospheric Research, Office of Ocean Exploration and Research(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); NOAA's National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science, Competitive Research Program(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, Gulf Research Program, Early-Career Fellowship","This research was funded by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Oceanic and Atmospheric Research, Office of Ocean Exploration and Research, under award NA18OAR0110289 to Santiago Herrera at Lehigh University and sub-awards to Andrea M Quattrini and Catherine S McFadden at Harvey Mudd College.

Spatial patterns of such connectivity depend not only on extrinsic factors such as oceanography and bathymetry but also on intrinsic species-specific factors such as life history, demography and the location of glacial refugia. Nevertheless, population structure is often inferred from related or ecologically similar species. For example, the population structure in most rockfish species (Sebastes spp.) in the Salish Sea and the US West Coast is currently inferred from genetic data of three species that are known to hybridise in Puget Sound. Here, we determined the population structure and connectivity in five Puget Sound Rockfish species (Black [Sebastes melanops], Yellowtail [S. flavidus], Redstripe [S. proriger], Greenstriped [S. elongatus], and Puget Sound Rockfish [S. emphaeus]) from over 12,000 restriction-site associated DNA sequencing (RADseq) loci. We found species-specific patterns of genetic differentiation, attributable to both extrinsic and intrinsic factors. Specifically, Black and Puget Sound rockfishes showed no genetic differentiation; Yellowtail and Greenstriped rockfishes were structured according to known geographic barriers; and Redstripe Rockfish revealed evidence for temporal genetic differentiation, suggesting irregular recruitment influences population structure. Only Yellowtail Rockfish followed the federal DPS boundaries generally assumed for rockfish, further emphasizing the importance of species-specific management for the effective recovery and management of these rockfish populations and of marine species in general.","[Wray, Anita; Petrou, Eleni; Hauser, Lorenz] Univ Washington, Sch Aquat & Fishery Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Nichols, Krista M.; Andrews, Kelly S.] NOAA, Northwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Conservat Biol Div, Seattle, WA USA; [Pacunski, Robert; Leclair, Larry] Washington Dept Fish & Wildlife, Olympia, WA USA; [Haggarty, Dana] Fisheries & Oceans Canada, Pacific Biol Stn, Nanaimo, BC, Canada; [Haggarty, Dana] Univ Victoria, Biol Dept, Victoria, BC, Canada; [Hauser, Lorenz] Nelson Mandela Univ, Zool Dept, Gqeberha, South Africa","University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Washington Department of Fish & Wildlife (WDFW); Fisheries & Oceans Canada; University of Victoria; Nelson Mandela University","Wray, A; Hauser, L (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Sch Aquat & Fishery Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.;Hauser, L (corresponding author), Nelson Mandela Univ, Zool Dept, Gqeberha, South Africa.","anita.wray14@gmail.com; lhauser@uw.edu","","Andrews, Kelly/0000-0001-7734-3800; Petrou, Eleni L./0000-0001-7811-9288","Sea Doc Society, Karen C.

The introduction of exotic tick species to new geographical regions can cause the emergence of novel tick-borne pathogens. This study examined the prevalence of exotic tick species parasitizing migratory songbirds at stopover sites along the northern Gulf of Mexico using the mitochondrial 12S rRNA gene.Methods Overall, 421 individual ticks in the genera Amblyomma, Haemaphysalis, and Ixodes were recorded from 28 songbird species, of which Amblyomma and Amblyomma longirostre were the most abundant tick genera and species, respectively. A high throughput 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing approach characterized the microbial communities and identified pathogenic microbes in all tick samples.Results and discussion Microbial profiles showed that Proteobacteria was the most abundant phylum. The most abundant pathogens were Rickettsia and endosymbiont Francisella, Candidatus Midichloria, and Spiroplasma. Permutation multivariate analysis of variance revealed that the relative abundance of Francisella and Rickettsia drives microbial patterns across the tick genera. We also noted a higher percentage of positive correlations in microbe-microbe interactions among members of the microbial communities. Network analysis suggested a negative correlation between a) Francisella and Rickettsia and, b) Francisella and Cutibacterium. Lastly, mapping the distributions of bird species parasitized during spring migrations highlighted geographic hotspots where migratory songbirds could disperse ticks and their pathogens at stopover sites or upon arrival to their breeding grounds, the latter showing mean dispersal distances from 421-5003 kilometers. These findings spotlight the potential role of migratory birds in the epidemiology of tick-borne pathogens.","[Karim, Shahid; Sen, Raima; Adegoke, Abdulsalam; Kumar, Deepak; Downs, Latoyia P.; Moore, Frank R.] Univ Southern Mississippi, Sch Biol Environm & Earth Sci, Hattiesburg, MS 39406 USA; [Zenzal Jr, Theodore J.] US Geol Survey, Wetland & Aquat Res Ctr, Lafayette, LA USA; [Beati, Lorenza; Keko, Mario; Nussbaum, Ashly] Georgia Southern Univ, Inst Coastal Plain Sci, Statesboro, GA USA; [Becker, Daniel J.] Univ Oklahoma, Sch Biol Sci, Norman, OK USA","University of Southern Mississippi; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; University System of Georgia; Georgia Southern University; University of Oklahoma System; University of Oklahoma - Norman","Karim, S (corresponding author), Univ Southern Mississippi, Sch Biol Environm & Earth Sci, Hattiesburg, MS 39406 USA.","Shahid.Karim@usm.edu","Adegoke, Abdulsalam/AFB-9021-2022; Keko, Mario/KRP-2108-2024","","Pakistan-U.S. Science and Technology Cooperation Program award (U.S. Department of State); Mississippi INBRE; National Institute of General Medical Sciences of the National Institutes of Health [P20GM103476]; NOAA RESTORE Act Science Program [NA17NOS4510092]; Alabama Ornithological Society; National Science Foundation [BII 2213854]","Pakistan-U.S. Science and Technology Cooperation Program award (U.S. Department of State); Mississippi INBRE; National Institute of General Medical Sciences of the National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS)); NOAA RESTORE Act Science Program(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); Alabama Ornithological Society; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF))","The author(s) declare financial support was received for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.

Gene abundances are influenced by chemical or physical conditions along with other factors, such as copy number variation between taxa, methodological biases, or issues associated with identification and classification. Here, we identify major drivers of spatiotemporal shifts in microbial gene relative abundance from multiple months, sites, and depths within Chesapeake Bay in 2017 using shotgun metagenomics. We compared changes in relative abundance of key genes for bacterial photosynthesis, nitrogen, and sulfur metabolism with each other and measured environmental variables. Major drivers of differences in key metabolic gene abundances are associated with environmental variables that largely change with depth and season (e.g., temperature, oxygen, phosphate). For sulfur oxidation, bacterial photosynthesis, and denitrification, genes within each process are generally significantly correlated with each other and with several environmental variables. For other processes, such as nitrification, nitrogen fixation, and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium, genes that encode enzymes within the same pathway are not well correlated. The lack of correlation typically results from differences in identified taxa carrying these genes, suggesting modular pathway structure, methodological errors, or discrepancies in gene copy number between taxonomic groups. To be suitable indicators of biogeochemical processes for models, genes or pathways should be strongly correlated with environmental variables and specific to and inclusive of all taxa mediating the associated process.","[Preheim, Sarah Pacocha; Zhang, Yue; Arora-Williams, Keith; Hinton, Amanda] Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Environm Hlth & Engn, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; [Morris, Shaina; Holder, Chris; Gensbigler, Paul; Jin, Rui; Pradal, Marie-Aude; Buchanan, Morgan; Gnanadesikan, Anand] Johns Hopkins Univ, Morton K Blaustein Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; [Zhang, Yue] Natl Inst Allergy & Infect Dis, Res Technol Branch, Integrated Data Sci Sect, Bethesda, MD USA; [Arora-Williams, Keith] Illumina, Bioinformat Dept, San Diego, CA USA","Johns Hopkins University; Johns Hopkins University; National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID); Illumina","Preheim, SP (corresponding author), Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Environm Hlth & Engn, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA.;Gnanadesikan, A (corresponding author), Johns Hopkins Univ, Morton K Blaustein Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA.","sprehei1@jhu.edu; gnandes@jhu.edu","Preheim, Sarah/B-3432-2010","Preheim, Sarah/0000-0001-7365-2382","Division of Graduate Education; Maryland Department of Natural Resources and Old Dominion Water Quality Laboratory; Johns Hopkins University Institute for Data Intensive Engineering and Science [1069213]; NSF Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship (Water) [131160]; Maryland Sea Grant; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce","Division of Graduate Education(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for STEM Education (EDU)); Maryland Department of Natural Resources and Old Dominion Water Quality Laboratory; Johns Hopkins University Institute for Data Intensive Engineering and Science; NSF Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship (Water); Maryland Sea Grant; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA)","Maryland Department of Natural Resources and Old Dominion Water Quality Laboratory made the hydrographic measurements and generously provided water samples collected during their Chesapeake Bay water quality monitoring program.

Conservation of endemic biodiversity may be more effective with require direct measurement of introgressed ancestry and fitness in wild populations, especially for keystone taxa at risk of hybridization following species introductions. We assessed the relationship of non-native ancestry with growth and body condition in the basin-restricted Neosho Bass ( Micropterus velox; NB), focussing on two streams in the NB native range that are admixed extensively with non-native Smallmouth Bass (M. dolomieu; SMB). We quantified the genetic composition of 116 fish from Big Sugar Creek (N = 46) and Elk River (N = 70) at 14 microsatellite loci. Using back-calculated total length-at-age estimated from sagittal otoliths, we assessed whether genetic ancestry explained variation in von Bertalanffy growth model parameters, accounting for sex and stream effects. We then assessed the relationship between ancestry and body condition. We found no differences in growth parameters by sex, stream, or ancestry, suggesting phenotypic homogenization which could be mediated by selection on body size. We found a negative correlation between SMB ancestry and condition, including lower condition in Big Sugar Creek, possibly reflecting a trade-off between maximum length and condition with respect to overall fitness.

Here we compare eDNA and gear-based assessments of marine fish populations using an approach that focuses on the commonest species. The protocol takes advantage of the hollow curve of species abundance distributions, with a minority of species comprising the great majority of individuals or biomass. We analyzed new and published teleost eDNA metabarcoding surveys from three neighboring northwest Atlantic coastal locations representing sandy, rocky, or estuary habitat. Fish eDNA followed a hollow curve species abundance distribution at each location-the 10 commonest taxa accounted for more than 90% of eDNA copies. Top ten taxa were designated eDNA-dominant species (eDDS) and categorized as habitat-associated (top 10 in one study) or as shared. eDDS by category were similarly abundant in concurrent bottom trawl and seine surveys. eDDS habitat category profiles correctly classified most (94%-100%) individual eDNA and capture measurements within surveys and recognized estuarine sites in other regional eDNA and seine studies. Using a category metric like that for habitats, eDDS demonstrated strong seasonal turnover concordant with trawl catch weights. eDNA seasonal profiles applied to historical trawl and seine records highlighted known long-term trends in mid-Atlantic fish populations. This study provides evidence that eDNA-abundant fish species differ among coastal habitats and by season consistent with gear-based assessments. Grouping abundant species by category facilitated comparisons among habitats and integration with established surveys. eDNA metabarcoding of dominant fish species potentially offers a useful tool for marine biogeography and ocean monitoring.","[Stoeckle, Mark Y.; Ausubel, Jesse H.] Rockefeller Univ, Program Human Environm, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Hinks, Greg; VanMorter, Stacy M.] New Jersey Dept Environm Protect, Bur Marine Fisheries, Port Republic, NJ USA","Rockefeller University","Stoeckle, MY (corresponding author), Rockefeller Univ, Program Human Environm, New York, NY 10065 USA.","mark.stoeckle@rockefeller.edu","Stoeckle, Mark/D-3729-2011","","NOAA Grants [NA20OAR01104XX, NA23OAR0110593]; US Fish and Wildlife Service Wildlife and Sport Fish Restoration Program; NOAA Interjurisdictional Fisheries Act of 1986 Grant [NA20NMF4070069]","NOAA Grants(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); US Fish and Wildlife Service Wildlife and Sport Fish Restoration Program; NOAA Interjurisdictional Fisheries Act of 1986 Grant","This work was supported by NOAA Grants NA20OAR01104XX (MYS,JHA), NA23OAR0110593 (MYS,JHA). https://www.noaa.gov/acquisition-grants The New Jersey Ocean Trawl Survey was supported by US Fish and Wildlife Service Wildlife and Sport Fish Restoration Program. https://www.fws.gov/program/sport-fish-restoration The Raritan Bay Seine Survey was supported by NOAA Interjurisdictional Fisheries Act of 1986 Grant NA20NMF4070069. https://www.noaa.gov/acquisition-grants.",NA,67,1,1,4,4,"PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE","SAN FRANCISCO","1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA","1932-6203","",NA,"PLOS ONE","PLoS One","NOV 11",2024,19,"11",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"e0313170","10.1371/journal.pone.0313170","http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0313170",NA,"",18,"Multidisciplinary Sciences","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Science & Technology - Other Topics","L7W4O",39527604,"gold, Green Published",NA,NA,"2025-01-20","WOS:001352786700044","View Full Record in Web of Science",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Microbial denitrification in soils and sediments is a major source of N2O, produced as an intermediate during the reduction of oxidized forms of nitrogen to dinitrogen gas (N2). Substrate availability (nitrate and organic matter) and environmental factors such as oxygen levels, temperature, moisture, and pH influence rates of denitrification and N2O production. Here we describe the role of physicochemical perturbation (defined here as a change from the ambient environmental conditions) in influencing rates of denitrification and N2O production. Changes in salinity, temperature, moisture, pH, and zinc in agricultural soils induced a short-term perturbation response characterized by lower rates of total denitrification and higher rates of net N2O production. The ratio of N2O to total denitrification (N2O : DNF) increased strongly with physicochemical perturbation. A salinity press experiment on tidal freshwater marsh soils revealed that increased N2O production was likely driven by transcriptional inhibition of the nitrous oxide reductase (nos) gene and that the microbial community adapted to altered salinity over a relatively short time frame (within 1 month). Perturbation appeared to confer resilience to subsequent disturbance, and denitrifiers from an environment without salinity fluctuations (tidal freshwater estuarine sediments) demonstrated a stronger N2O perturbation response than denitrifiers from environments with more variable salinity (oligohaline and mesohaline estuarine sediments), suggesting that the denitrifying community from physicochemically stable environments may have a stronger perturbation response. These findings provide a framework for improving our understanding of the dynamic nature of N2O production in soils and sediments, in which changes in physical and/or chemical conditions initiate a short-term perturbation response that promotes N2O production that moderates over time and with subsequent physicochemical perturbation.","[Weston, Nathaniel B.; Troy, Cynthia] Villanova Univ, Dept Geog & Environm, Villanova, PA 19085 USA; [Kearns, Patrick J.; Bowen, Jennifer L.] Northeastern Univ, Marine Sci Ctr, Dept Marine & Environm Sci, Nahant, MA 01908 USA; [Porubsky, William] Algenol Biofuels, Ft Myers, FL 33912 USA; [Hyacinthe, Christelle; Meile, Christof; Joye, Samantha B.] Univ Georgia, Dept Marine Sci, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Van Cappellen, Philippe] Univ Waterloo, Water Inst, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Waterloo, ON, Canada; [Kearns, Patrick J.] Univ Massachusetts Boston, Dept Biol, Boston, MA 02125 USA","Villanova University; Northeastern University; University System of Georgia; University of Georgia; University of Waterloo; University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Boston","Weston, NB (corresponding author), Villanova Univ, Dept Geog & Environm, Villanova, PA 19085 USA.","nathaniel.weston@villanova.edu","; Weston, Nathaniel/A-6545-2009","Meile, Christof/0000-0002-0825-4596; Weston, Nathaniel/0000-0002-6837-360X","National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration","National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA)","We thank Margaret Garcia, Thomas Hoffman, Hillary Koch, Anniet Laverman, Hal Leaman, Justin Meschter, Jack Middelburg, Gerard Ondrey, Melanie Vile, and Justin Walsh for assisting with field collection and/or laboratory analyses.",NA,87,0,0,6,6,"COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH","GOTTINGEN","BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY","1726-4170","1726-4189",NA,"BIOGEOSCIENCES","Biogeosciences","NOV 6",2024,21,"21",NA,NA,NA,NA,4837,4851,"","10.5194/bg-21-4837-2024","http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/bg-21-4837-2024",NA,"",15,"Ecology; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology","L0U8H",NA,"gold, Green Submitted",NA,NA,"2025-01-20","WOS:001347968800001","View Full Record in Web of Science",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This practice has been prevalent in fisheries for centuries and is often termed 'stocking'. In the Laurentian Great Lakes (Great Lakes here-on), walleye populations faced declines from the 1950s to the 1970s, prompting extensive stocking efforts for restoration. By the mid-2010s, walleye populations showed signs of recovery, but the genetic legacy of stocking on population structure at the genomic level remains unclear. Using a dataset of 45,600 genome-aligned SNP loci genotyped in 1075 walleye individuals, we investigated the genetic impacts of over 50 years of stocking across the Great Lakes. Population structure was associated with both natural geographic barriers and stocking from non-native sources. Admixture between Lake Erie walleye and walleye from the re-populated Tittabawassee River indicate that stocking may have re-distributed putatively adaptive alleles around the Great Lakes. Genome scans identified FST outliers and evidence of selective sweeps, indicating local adaptation of spawning populations is likely. Notably, one genomic region showed strong differentiation between Muskegon River and walleye from the Tittabawassee River, which was re-populated by Muskegon strain walleye, suggesting admixture and selection both impact the observed genetic diversity. Overall, our study underscores how artificial propagation and translocations can significantly alter the evolutionary trajectory of populations. The findings highlight the complex interplay between stocking practices and population genetic diversity, emphasising the need for careful management strategies to preserve the genetic integrity of wild populations amidst conservation efforts.","[Euclide, Peter T.] Purdue Univ, Dept Forestry & Nat Resources, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Euclide, Peter T.] Purdue Univ, Illinois Indiana Sea Grant, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Kuhl, Heiner] Leibniz Inst Freshwater Ecol & Inland Fisheries, Dept Fish Biol 4, Fisheries & Aquaculture, Berlin, Germany; [Wilson, Chris C.] Trent Univ, Sci & Res Branch, Ontario Minist Nat Resources, Peterborough, ON, Canada; [Scribner, Kim T.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife, E Lansing, MI USA; [Miller, Loren M.] Minnesota Dept Nat Resource, St Paul, MN USA; [Stott, Wendylee] Freshwater Inst, Fisheries & Oceans Canada, Winnipeg, MB, Canada; [Larson, Wesley A.] Natl Oceanog & Atmospher Adm, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Alaska Fisheries Sci Ctr, Auke Bay Labs, Juneau, AK USA","Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University System; Purdue University; Leibniz Association; Leibniz Institut fur Gewasserokologie und Binnenfischerei (IGB); Trent University; Ministry of Natural Resources & Forestry; Michigan State University; Fisheries & Oceans Canada; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA","Euclide, PT (corresponding author), Purdue Univ, Dept Forestry & Nat Resources, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.;Euclide, PT (corresponding author), Purdue Univ, Illinois Indiana Sea Grant, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.","peuclide@purdue.edu","Euclide, Peter/ADE-4080-2022; Kuhl, Heiner/L-2737-2019; Wilson, Chris/J-4851-2012","Larson, Wesley/0000-0003-4473-3401; Kuhl, Heiner/0000-0001-7623-9227; Miller, Loren/0000-0002-5482-2152; Euclide, Peter/0000-0002-1212-0435; Wilson, Chris/0000-0002-9528-0652","Great Lakes Fishery Commission; [2019_LAR_440830]","Great Lakes Fishery Commission;","We thank the many state, federal and tribal partners who collected samples for our analysis and who continue to keep records of the management and stocking activities ongoing in their jurisdictions.

It relies on resource-intensive sampling and data analysis. Within this context, the emergence of machine learning (ML) systems holds significant promise for understanding disparate components of these marine ecosystems and gaining a greater understanding of their dynamics. The goal of this paper is to present a review of ML applications in fisheries science. It highlights both their advantages over conventional approaches and their drawbacks, particularly in terms of operationality and possible robustness issues. This review is organized from small to large scales. It begins with genomics and subsequently expands to individuals (catch items), aggregations of different species in situ, on-board processing, stock/populations assessment and dynamics, spatial mapping, fishing-related organizational units, and finally ecosystem dynamics. Each field has its own set of challenges, such as pre-processing steps, the quantity and quality of training data, the necessity of appropriate model validation, and knowing where ML algorithms are more limited, and we discuss some of these discipline-specific challenges. The scope of discussion of applied methods ranges from conventional statistical methods to data-specific approaches that use a higher level of semantics. The paper concludes with the potential implications of ML applications on management decisions and a summary of the benefits and challenges of using these techniques in fisheries.","[Kuehn, Bernhard; Cayetano, Arjay] Thunen Inst Sea Fisheries, Marine Living Resources, Bremerhaven, Germany; [Fincham, Jennifer I.] Cefas, Lowestoft, England; [Moustahfid, Hassan] NOAA, US Integrated Ocean Observing Syst, Silver Spring, MD USA; [Sokolova, Maria] Wageningen Univ & Res, Wageningen Marine Res, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Trifonova, Neda] Univ Aberdeen, Sch Biol Sci, Aberdeen, Scotland; [Watson, Jordan T.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Pacific Isl Ocean Observing Syst PacIOOS, Honolulu, HI USA; [Fernandes-Salvador, Jose A.] Basque Res & Technol Alliance BRTA, AZTI, Marine Res, Sukarrieta, Spain; [Uusitalo, Laura] Nat Resources Inst Finland Luke, Fisheries & Fish Resources, Helsinki, Finland","Johann Heinrich von Thunen Institute; Centre for Environment Fisheries & Aquaculture Science; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Wageningen University & Research; University of Aberdeen; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; AZTI; Natural Resources Institute Finland (Luke)","Uusitalo, L (corresponding author), Nat Resources Inst Finland luke, Latokartanonkaari 9, FI-00790 Helsinki, Finland.","laura.uusitalo@luke.fi","Sokolova, Maria/IST-5468-2023; Salvador, Jose/AAH-7939-2019","Trifonova, Neda/0000-0003-3332-4901; Fernandes Salvador, Jose Antonio/0000-0003-4677-6077","H2020 project PANDORA [773713]; H2020 project SEAwise [101000318]; H2020 project SusTunTech [869342]; H2020 project FutureMARES [869300]; H2020 project OBAMA-NEXT [101081642]; H2020 project OptiFish [101136674]; BioBoost+project within the Biodiversa+European Biodiversity Partnership program; European Union","H2020 project PANDORA; H2020 project SEAwise; H2020 project SusTunTech; H2020 project FutureMARES; H2020 project OBAMA-NEXT; H2020 project OptiFish; BioBoost+project within the Biodiversa+European Biodiversity Partnership program; European Union(European Union (EU))","BK has received funding from the H2020 projects PANDORA (#773713) and SEAwise (#101000318).

By gaining a comprehensive understanding of population connectivity, more effective management can be prioritized. To assess the connectivity and population genetic structure of a common cold-water coral species, Desmophyllum pertusum (Lophelia pertusa), we performed Restriction-site Associated DNA Sequencing (RADseq) on individuals from nine sites ranging from submarine canyons off New England to the southeastern coast of the United States (SEUS) and the Gulf of Mexico (GOM). Fifty-seven individuals and 3,180 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were used to assess genetic differentiation.ResultsHigh connectivity exists among populations along the SEUS, yet these populations were differentiated from those to the north off New England and in Norfolk Canyon along the North Atlantic coast of the United States, as well as those in the GOM. Interestingly, Norfolk Canyon, located just north of North Carolina, and GOM populations exhibited low levels of genetic differentiation, corroborating previous microsatellite analyses and signifying gene flow between these populations. Increasing sample sizes from existing populations and including additional sampling sites over a larger geographic range would help define potential source populations and reveal fine-scale connectivity patterns among D. pertusum populations.","[Weinnig, Alexis M.; Aunins, Aaron W.; Salamone, Veronica; Morrison, Cheryl L.] US Geol Survey, Eastern Ecol Sci Ctr, Leetown Res Lab, Kearneysville, WV 25430 USA; [Quattrini, Andrea M.; Nizinski, Martha S.] Smithsonian Inst, Natl Museum Nat Hist, Dept Invertebrate Zool, Washington, DC USA; [Nizinski, Martha S.] NOAA Fisheries, Natl Systemat Lab, Off Sci & Technol, Washington, DC 20560 USA","United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; Smithsonian Institution; Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA","Weinnig, AM (corresponding author), US Geol Survey, Eastern Ecol Sci Ctr, Leetown Res Lab, Kearneysville, WV 25430 USA.","aweinnig@usgs.gov","","","U.S. Department of the Interior","U.S. Department of the Interior","We would like to thank the captains, crew, and scientists who coordinated and participated in the research cruises that provided samples for this study.

Until recently, inadequate sample sizes in many regions constrained efforts to characterise population genetic structure throughout the coastal waters of Alaska. Here, tissue samples from beachcast strandings and fisheries bycatch were supplemented with targeted environmental DNA (eDNA) samples in key regions of Alaska coastal and inland waters. Using a geographically explicit, hierarchical approach, we examined the genetic structure of Alaska harbour porpoises, using both mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequence data and multilocus SNP genotypes. Despite a lack of evidence of genetic differentiation from nuclear SNP loci, patterns of relatedness and genetic differentiation from mtDNA suggest natal philopatry at multiple geographic scales, with limited gene flow among sites possibly mediated by male dispersal. A priori clustering of sampled areas at an intermediate scale (eastern and western Bering Sea, Gulf of Alaska and Southeast Alaska) best explained the genetic variance (12.37%) among regions. In addition, mtDNA differentiation between the Gulf of Alaska and eastern Bering Sea, and among regions within the Gulf of Alaska, indicated significant genetic structuring of harbour porpoise populations in Southeast Alaska. The targeted collection of eDNA samples from strata within Southeast Alaska was key for elevating the statistical power of our mtDNA dataset, and findings indicate limited dispersal between neighbouring strata within coastal and inland waters. These results provide evidence supporting a population boundary within the currently recognised Southeast Alaska Stock. Together, these findings will prove useful for ongoing management efforts to reduce fisheries conflict and conserve genetic diversity in this iconic coastal species.","[Parsons, Kim M.; Park, Linda] NOAA, Conservat Biol Div, Northwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Seattle, WA 98115 USA; [May, Samuel A.] Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Coll Fisheries & Ocean Sci, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA; [Gold, Zachary] NOAA, Ocean Mol Ecol Grp, Pacific Marine Environm Lab, Ocean & Atmospher Res, Seattle, WA USA; [Dahlheim, Marilyn; Goetz, Kimberly] NOAA, Marine Mammal Lab, Alaska Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Seattle, WA 98115 USA; [Gabriele, Christine] Glacier Bay Natl Pk & Preserve, Gustavus, AK USA; [Straley, Janice M.] Univ Alaska Southeast, Appl Fisheries, Sitka, AK 99835 USA; [Moran, John R.] NOAA, Auke Bay Labs, Alaska Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Juneau, AK 99801 USA; [Zerbini, Alexandre N.] Univ Washington, Cooperat Inst Climate Ocean Ecosyst Studies CICOES, Seattle, WA USA; [Zerbini, Alexandre N.] NOAA, Marine Mammal Lab, Alaska Fisheries Sci Ctr, Seattle, WA 98115 USA; [Zerbini, Alexandre N.] Marine Ecol & Telemetry Res, Seabeck, WA 98380 USA; [Morin, Phillip A.] NOAA, Marine Mammal Genet Program, Southwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA","National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of Alaska System; University of Alaska Fairbanks; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of Alaska System; University of Alaska Southeastern; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA","Parsons, KM (corresponding author), NOAA, Conservat Biol Div, Northwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Seattle, WA 98115 USA.","kim.parsons@noaa.gov","Parsons, Kim/A-8050-2011; Gold, Zachary/KBA-8921-2024","Parsons, Kim/0000-0003-4580-3651","Office of Protected Resources, NOAA Fisheries; NOAA Office of Protected Resources","Office of Protected Resources, NOAA Fisheries; NOAA Office of Protected Resources(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA)","We are grateful to the many fisheries observers and many veterinarians and volunteers through the Marine Mammal Stranding Networks who dedicated their time and expertise to contribute tissue samples to the SWFSC Marine Mammal and Sea Turtle Research (MMASTR) collection over the past several decades.

To address this gap, we investigated the feeding ecology of this demersal deep-water snapper using two molecular approaches: single-species barcoding and multispecies metabarcoding. Between November 2019 and July 2020, we collected 157 queen snapper from seven locations along the west coast of Puerto Rico. Our analysis identified a diverse array of prey items in the stomachs, comprising 61 species from 31 families, 18 orders, and 38 genera. Our findings suggest that E. oculatus is a large carnivore, primarily preying on squids, shrimps, and deep-water fishes. Notably, common fish prey included Diaphus brachycephalus, D. dumerilii, Dasyscopelus selenops, Coccorella atlantica, Sigmops elongatus, and Zaphotias pedaliotus. In contrast, prevalent invertebrate prey consisted of Abralia veranyi, Doryteuthis pealeii, Abralia redfieldi, Oplophorus gracilirostris, and Systellaspis debilis. Although our data suggest potential variation in diet composition across locations, definitive conclusions remain elusive. However, we observed heightened prey richness at seamount Pichincho, possibly attributable to the high structural complexity of the karst terrain on the seafloor. Additionally, we noted variation in prey species composition across size classes, with certain species more prevalent in larger or smaller queen snapper. Given the challenge of examining the prey of deep-water fish species, our study showcases the utility of both single-species barcoding and multispecies metabarcoding methodologies in characterizing the dietary range of queen snapper and similar demersal deep-water carnivorous fishes. The multispecies metabarcoding approach, in particular, offers a rapid, comprehensive, and effective means of identifying prey species. As the commercial value of the queen snapper continues to rise, our investigation into its feeding behavior provides critical baseline information for future species management efforts. By enhancing our understanding of its ecological dynamics, we aim to contribute to informed conservation and sustainable fisheries practices in the region.","[Williams, Stacey M.] Coastal Survey Solut LLC, Lajas, PR 00667 USA; [Prada, Carlos] Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Biol Sci, Kingston, RI USA; [Beltran, Diana M.] Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Nat Resources Sci, Kingston, RI USA","University of Rhode Island; University of Rhode Island","Williams, SM (corresponding author), Coastal Survey Solut LLC, Lajas, PR 00667 USA.","stcmwilliams@gmail.com","","","Caribbean Fisheries Management Council [NA15NMF4410012]; Caribbean Fisheries Management Council (NOAA CRCP CFMC Grant) [NA17NMF4410270]; Florida Wildlife Federation, Inc; Pew Charitable Trusts Conserving Marine Life in the United States; USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture [1017848]","Caribbean Fisheries Management Council; Caribbean Fisheries Management Council (NOAA CRCP CFMC Grant); Florida Wildlife Federation, Inc; Pew Charitable Trusts Conserving Marine Life in the United States; USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA))","The author(s) declare financial support was received for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.

In the western North Atlantic Ocean, the population structure of the Atlantic angel shark (Squatina dumeril) is not fully understood; therefore, the portioning of genetic variation was assessed among individuals caught along the east coast of the United States (Atlantic) and on the northern Gulf of Mexico (Gulf) using reduced representation genomics and mitochondrial sequencing. Three distinct groups were delineated with nuclear data, the Atlantic, the eastern Gulf, and the western Gulf, along boundaries described by previous research. Mitochondrial data only resolved two groups, with the western Gulf separated from the eastern Gulf and Atlantic combined. Demographic modeling suggested that the Atlantic population separated from a single Gulf population which subsequently split into eastern and western populations. Additionally, there was evidence that adjacent populations experienced gene flow after splitting, which may explain the incongruence between results based on nuclear and mtCR data. Correlations between environmental variables and allele frequencies at 873 loci indicated potential local adaptation. Therefore, the preservation of all three groups is necessary for the conservation of long-term adaptive variation important for species persistence.","[Fields, Andrew T.; Portnoy, David S.] Texas A&M Univ Corpus Christi, Dept Life Sci, Marine Genom Lab, 6300 Ocean Dr, Corpus Christi, TX 78412 USA; [Driggers III, William B.; Jones, Christian M.] NOAA, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, SE Fisheries Sci Ctr, PO Drawer 1207, Pascagoula, MS 39568 USA","Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University Corpus Christi; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)","Fields, AT; Portnoy, DS (corresponding author), Texas A&M Univ Corpus Christi, Dept Life Sci, Marine Genom Lab, 6300 Ocean Dr, Corpus Christi, TX 78412 USA.","andrew.fields.biologist@gmail.com; David.Portnoy@tamucc.edu","","Portnoy, David/0000-0002-8178-1018; Jones, Christian/0000-0001-5093-1127; Fields, Andrew/0000-0002-2817-2141","Life Science Department at Texas A&M University at Corpus Christi","Life Science Department at Texas A&M University at Corpus Christi","David Portnoy has received research support from the Life Science Department at Texas A&M University at Corpus Christi.",NA,103,0,0,2,2,"SPRINGER","NEW YORK","ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES","0378-1909","1573-5133",NA,"ENVIRON BIOL FISH","Environ.

Three other species analyzed (Malacosteus niger, Nemichthys scolopaceus, and Scopelogadus beanii) showed more variability between sampling years. COI sequences were classified into eight invertebrate prey groups, within which prey species were detected and identified. Considering all predator species together, a total of 77 prey species were detected with a minimum of 1,000 COI sequences, including 22 copepods, 18 euphausiids, and 7 amphipods. Morphological prey counts were classified into seven taxonomic groups, including a gelatinous group comprised of soft-bodied organisms. The ocean twilight zone or is home to exceptional diversity and biomass of marine fish, which are key players in deep sea food webs. This study used integrative morphological-molecular analysis to provide new insights into trophic relationships and sources of productivity for mesopelagic fishes, including identification of key prey species, recognition of the importance of gelatinous prey, and characterization of differences in diet among fish predators in the NW Atlantic Slope Water.","[Bucklin, Ann; Batta-Lona, Paola G.; Wojcicki, Melissa] Univ Connecticut, Dept Marine Sci, Groton, CT 06340 USA; [Questel, Jennifer M.] Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Inst Marine Sci, Fairbanks, AK USA; [McMonagle, Helena; Llopiz, Joel K.; Glancy, Sarah; Caiger, Paul E.; Francolini, Rene; Govindarajan, Annette; Thorrold, Simon R.; Wiebe, Peter H.] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Biol Dept, Woods Hole, MA USA; [McMonagle, Helena] Univ Washington, Sch Aquat & Fishery Sci, Seattle, WA USA; [Caiger, Paul E.] Univ Auckland, Inst Marine Sci, Auckland, New Zealand; [Jech, Michael] Natl Ocean & Atmospher Adm NOAA Fisheries, Northeast Fisheries Sci Ctr, Woods Hole, MA USA","University of Connecticut; University of Alaska System; University of Alaska Fairbanks; Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; University of Auckland; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA","Bucklin, A (corresponding author), Univ Connecticut, Dept Marine Sci, Groton, CT 06340 USA.","ann.bucklin@uconn.edu","McMonagle, Helena/JEZ-3188-2023; Batta-Lona, Paola G/B-7848-2016","Batta-Lona, Paola G/0000-0002-6477-6110","National Science Foundation10.13039/100000001 [157]; Scientific Committee on Oceanic Research (SCOR) Working Group; NOAA Northeast Fisheries Science Center (Narragansett, RI, USA)","National Science Foundation10.13039/100000001; Scientific Committee on Oceanic Research (SCOR) Working Group; NOAA Northeast Fisheries Science Center (Narragansett, RI, USA)","We acknowledge contributions of the Scientific Committee on Oceanic Research (SCOR) Working Group 157, MetaZooGene: Toward a new global view of marine zooplankton biodiversity based on DNA metabarcoding and reference DNA sequence databases (https://metazoogene.org/ and https://scor-int.org/group/157/).

These advances rely on tools such as blockchain data handling, eDNA or eRNA (together 'eNA') sampling, DNA metabarcoding, artificial intelligence and mobile applications. The microbiota associated with seafood organisms can also be monitored using eNA, to enable detection and management of any potential pathogenic developments in wild or aquaculture stocks. For successful and efficient traceability, it is necessary to guarantee data reliability and to support regulatory auditing. To ensure sustainability, however, also requires sampling, monitoring and assessments of the resource status as well as appropriate management. Effective traceability of seafood-related products will also help to resolve other problems, such as endangered species entering supply chains for aquaculture feed. Considering the still large proportion of seafood that is currently obtained and processed illegally, there is a pressing need for coherent local, national and international policies rooted in shared goals among stakeholders and supported by even-handed enforcement. This has been recently facilitated through a trend to shift liability from fishers to importers, and onwards throughout the value chain. In hand with these regulatory changes, the technologies described here will play a central role in achieving the vision for sustainable seafood supplies by the end of this decade.","[Gleadall, I.

Closely related resident populations (known as rainbow trout) may be an effective resource in the recovery of these declining migratory populations. However, the extent to which different populations of resident rainbow trout produce migratory individuals and how likely these individuals are to return as adults to spawn remains unknown. One limitation to answering these questions is the identification of loci that accurately segregate between migratory and resident populations. To address this limitation, we used existing genomic data from a well-studied population of O. mykiss from Southeastern Alaska (Sashin Creek) to identify loci that segregate between phenotypes. We then utilized Double Mismatch Allele-Specific qPCR (DMAS-qPCR) to genotype 233 smolts out-migrating from Sashin Creek and 99 returning adult steelhead trout across a five-year period to determine (a) the origin of out-migrating smolts and returning adults and (b) to quantify the extent to which the resident population contributes to the migratory population. Our results show that 37.3% of out-migrating smolts were produced from resident parents, whereas 19.3% of returning adults had resident parents. Ultimately, these results demonstrate that resident populations of rainbow trout produce migrant offspring that successfully complete their migration and return to spawn, increasing population sizes and likely improving genetic diversity. Therefore, conservation efforts should consider landlocked resident populations for producing smolts when developing recovery plans for migratory steelhead populations.","[Barfuss, Evan J.; Brown, Bridey E.; Sachdeva, Shriya; Smith, Asher B.; Hale, Matthew C.] Texas Christian Univ, Dept Biol, Ft Worth, TX 76109 USA; [Thrower, Frank P.; Waters, Charles D.] NOAA, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Alaska Fisheries Sci Ctr, Auke Bay Labs, Juneau, AK USA; [Nichols, Krista M.] NOAA, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Northwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Conservat Biol Div, Seattle, WA USA","Texas Christian University; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA","Hale, MC (corresponding author), Texas Christian Univ, Dept Biol, Ft Worth, TX 76109 USA.","m.c.hale@tcu.edu","","","Texas Christian University; [UG210610]","Texas Christian University;","The authors would like to thank Wes Larson, Natasha Howe, Juliana Cornett, Devon Pearse, and one anonymous reviewer for comments, edits, and suggestions on previous versions of this manuscript.

This memory formation, termed olfactory imprinting, involves (at least in part) sensitization of the peripheral olfactory epithelium to specific odorants. We hypothesized that this change in peripheral sensitivity is due to exposure-dependent increases in the expression of odorant receptor (OR) proteins that are activated by specific odorants experienced during imprinting. To test this hypothesis, we exposed juvenile coho salmon, Oncorhynchus kisutch, , to the basic amino acid odorant L-arginine during the parr-smolt transformation (PST), when imprinting occurs, and assessed sensitivity of the olfactory epithelium to this and other odorants. We then identified the coho salmon ortholog of a basic amino acid odorant receptor (BAAR) and determined the mRNA expression levels of this receptor and other transcripts representing different classes of OR families. Exposure to L-arginine during the PST resulted in increased sensitivity to that odorant and a specific increase in BAAR mRNA expression in the olfactory epithelium relative to other ORs. These results suggest that specific increases in ORs activated during imprinting may be an important component of home stream memory formation and this phenomenon may ultimately be useful as a marker of successful imprinting to assess management strategies and hatchery practices that may influence straying in salmon.","[Dittman, Andrew H.; Baldwin, David H.; Scholz, Nathaniel L.] NOAA, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Northwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Environm & Fisheries Sci Div, 2725 Montlake Blvd East, Seattle, WA 98112 USA; [May, Darran] Univ Washington, Sch Aquat & Fishery Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Johnson, Marc A.] Wildlife Corvallis Res Lab, Oregon Dept Fish, 28655 Highway 34, Corvallis, OR 97333 USA; [Johnson, Marc A.] NOAA Fisheries, Sustainable Fisheries Div, West Coast Reg, 1201 Northeast Lloyd Blvd,Suite 1100, Portland, OR 97232 USA","National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA","Dittman, AH (corresponding author), NOAA, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Northwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Environm & Fisheries Sci Div, 2725 Montlake Blvd East, Seattle, WA 98112 USA.","andy.dittman@noaa.gov","; Scholz, Nathaniel/L-1642-2013","Dittman, Andrew/0000-0001-6482-359X; Scholz, Nathaniel/0000-0001-6207-0272; Johnson, Marc/0000-0003-0827-1887","Bonneville Power Administration [1993-056-00]; Hatchery Scientific Review Group [FP7210-RL1AW7210]","Bonneville Power Administration; Hatchery Scientific Review Group","This work was supported by the Bonneville Power Administration [Project 1993-056-00 to A.D.] and the Hatchery Scientific Review Group [FP7210-RL1AW7210 to A.D.] .",NA,116,1,1,6,6,"COMPANY BIOLOGISTS LTD","CAMBRIDGE","BIDDER BUILDING, STATION RD, HISTON, CAMBRIDGE CB24 9LF, ENGLAND","0022-0949","1477-9145",NA,"J EXP BIOL","J.

However, a key obstacle in utilizing eDNA data for ecosystem management is uncertainty surrounding the ability to estimate abundance or biomass of multiple species simultaneously. In this study, we use experimental trials with known biomasses of multiple species to explore the feasibility of (1) estimating species proportions from eDNA metabarcoding data and (2) estimating absolute eDNA concentrations of multiple species by scaling metabarcoding proportions with eDNA concentrations of a single species obtained from qPCR. The focal species for this study were three gadid fishes that are key components of marine ecosystems in Alaska and vary in their distribution and habitat use: Walleye pollock (Gadus chalcogrammus), Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus), and Arctic cod (Boreogadus saida). After designing gadid-specific metabarcoding primers and accounting for PCR biases in the metabarcoding data, we found corrected read proportions closely approximated the true biomass proportions of species. Furthermore, we found strong positive relationships between absolute eDNA concentration and absolute biomass for Arctic cod and Pacific cod using quantitative metabarcoding data combined with estimates of Walleye pollock eDNA concentration derived from qPCR. These findings suggest that it is possible to accurately quantify species compositions and estimate metrics of biomass for gadids in real-world scenarios. Furthermore, this work provides a framework for developing primers and analytical approaches that can be applied to other species to improve the quantitative utility of eDNA.","[Ledger, Kimberly J.; Larson, Wes; Baetscher, Diana S.] NOAA, Auke Bay Labs, Alaska Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Juneau, AK 99801 USA; [Ledger, Kimberly J.] Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Coll Fisheries & Ocean Sci, Juneau, AK 99801 USA; [Hicks, Mary Beth Rew; Hurst, Thomas P.] NOAA, Alaska Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Newport Lab, Newport, OR USA","National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of Alaska System; University of Alaska Fairbanks; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA","Ledger, KJ (corresponding author), NOAA, Auke Bay Labs, Alaska Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Juneau, AK 99801 USA.;Ledger, KJ (corresponding author), Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Coll Fisheries & Ocean Sci, Juneau, AK 99801 USA.","kimberly.ledger@noaa.gov","Ledger, Kimberly/O-2151-2017","Larson, Wesley/0000-0003-4473-3401","Cooperative Institute for Climate, Ocean, and Ecosystem Studies (CICOES) under NOAA Cooperative [NA20OAR4320271]","Cooperative Institute for Climate, Ocean, and Ecosystem Studies (CICOES) under NOAA Cooperative","This publication is funded by the Cooperative Institute for Climate, Ocean, and Ecosystem Studies (CICOES) under NOAA Cooperative Agreement NA20OAR4320271, Contribution No. 2024-1370.",NA,63,0,0,4,4,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","2637-4943","",NA,"ENVIRON DNA","Environ.
